Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.","Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."

Joey Tribbiani,Her answer machine?,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?",What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.","I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",Joey... Switzerland?
Joey Tribbiani,"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.",Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Joey Tribbiani,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.",Might wanna try Joseph.
Joey Tribbiani,Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!,"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof."
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!","I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?"
Joey Tribbiani,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
Joey Tribbiani,You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?,You're kidding.
Joey Tribbiani,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
Joey Tribbiani,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",...He's in.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.","Thanks Joey, that's a good idea."
Joey Tribbiani,Stegosaurus!,Tyrannosaurus!
Joey Tribbiani,For the ride.,"Yeah, like in a cab..."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.","Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, just had a baby.",Mazel tov!
Joey Tribbiani,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.,You are really frightening me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.","Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
Joey Tribbiani,"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.",... And where's this money coming from?
Joey Tribbiani,We make fire. Cook meat.,"Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.",Crazy bitch.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?,Forget about her.
Joey Tribbiani,"He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.","Course there, they just call it food."
Joey Tribbiani,"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.",I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Joey Tribbiani,"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.",Ooooh.
Joey Tribbiani,Shhhh!,...spender.
Joey Tribbiani,She's still asleep.,So how'd it go?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!","Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
Joey Tribbiani,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",I didn't know you had another level.
Joey Tribbiani,Seven hundred bucks!,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.","Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Needs some clothes altered?,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
Joey Tribbiani,"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?",Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.",Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.","Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!"
Joey Tribbiani,No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.,"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...",That's ok.
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler?,"So, uh, how often can you do it?"
Joey Tribbiani,What is the big deal?,What did you just do?
Joey Tribbiani,"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.","Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
Joey Tribbiani,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.","All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah I guess you're right.,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna do it.,All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.",You or me?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.","April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent."
Joey Tribbiani,"Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.","Wow, he looks so normal."
Joey Tribbiani,"""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.",Funniest? Heckles?
Joey Tribbiani,That's what it says.,"Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?,"Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool."
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you were both dorks. Big deal.","I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?"
Joey Tribbiani,Have you been here all night?,"Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did."
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.","Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.","What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.",How do you know that? How?
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.","You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?","Yeah, I understand."
Joey Tribbiani,"You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?",You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Joey Tribbiani,Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.,"Hi, it's me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?",I'll take that.
Joey Tribbiani,You want his yearbook?,"Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it."
Joey Tribbiani,The Ice Capades?,"No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny."
Joey Tribbiani,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.",Nice work my friend.
Joey Tribbiani,Do we need a cake?,"Look guys, I know it's a little steep."
Joey Tribbiani,All right.,"I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing."
Joey Tribbiani,"What are these, like famous chickens?","Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?"

Joey Tribbiani,"What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?","I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window."
Joey Tribbiani,Consider it done.,You understood that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.",Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Joey Tribbiani,"It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.","No, I got him."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, seriously.","Oh, seriously you want him?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, look at that talent.",Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",You know it?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm him.,"Actually, uh, we're both the father."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.",Ok.
Joey Tribbiani,"Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.",Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,"Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off."
Joey Tribbiani,Ahh!,What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.","Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?"
Joey Tribbiani,You got a better idea?,"All right, call it in the air."
Joey Tribbiani,Heads.,Heads it is.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Whew!,We have to assign heads to something.
Joey Tribbiani,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.",What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross.",Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.","Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.","Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?","Alright. ""It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, I do.",What are you doing out there?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?","Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad."
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.",Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Joey Tribbiani,She told us.,So whaddya got there Monica?
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe here with the cab yet?,"Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.","Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, here she comes.",Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.","OK, Phoebs, your turn."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, the part's mine if I want it.",Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.",Oh my... God?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.","So, what're you gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?","Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know."
Joey Tribbiani,I've never slept with someone for a part.,Well is she...
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry.,It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.","Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas."
Joey Tribbiani,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Joey Tribbiani,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.,So what'd you do?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.","Whoa, she's pretty."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.","Oh, ok."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.,Nice!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""","That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect."
Joey Tribbiani,"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.","Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding."
Joey Tribbiani,I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?,Isn't Ben in this?

Joey Tribbiani,Let's get out of here.,The one time they're not home.
Joey Tribbiani,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.",That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?","Wait, wait, wait."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.","Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done."
Joey Tribbiani,Ma?,Joey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.","Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you naked in there?,Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Joey Tribbiani,"Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?","No, no, this is the first time."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.","I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, let me see.","No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever."
Joey Tribbiani,"Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.",How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.",Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.

Joey Tribbiani,Eight hundred and twelve bucks.,"Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.","Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.","Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say."
Joey Tribbiani,"Heh, what d'ya say?",I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Joey Tribbiani,"Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.",To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Joey Tribbiani,Put it on.,"Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.",I so am.
Joey Tribbiani,You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?,"Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track."
Joey Tribbiani,"If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.","Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?","OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there."
Joey Tribbiani,You know what the. . .,"I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . ."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,How come you have two?,Well this one's for you.
Joey Tribbiani,Get out.,"No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",That's what they'll call us.
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.","Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes."
Joey Tribbiani,Alright open your eyes.,Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Joey Tribbiani,Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.,Congratulations!

Joey Tribbiani,"Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.",Ohh yes.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.",Do we dare?

Joey Tribbiani,What?,The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so.",Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.","Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Joey Tribbiani,Can you believe this place?,"I know, this is a great apartment."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.","Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously."
Joey Tribbiani,Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.,"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.",Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.",What?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.","Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware."
Joey Tribbiani,"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.","Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."
Joey Tribbiani,Well that's how I feel.,Well then maybe you should take it.
Joey Tribbiani,Well then maybe I will.,Fine with me.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .",Yeah me too.

Joey Tribbiani,"These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.",What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.","No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm movin' out like we talked about.,Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.","Well, there you go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.","Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there."

Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?","Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.","Yeah, I remember."
Joey Tribbiani,"Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.",Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, I guess this is it.","Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so."

Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, they're runnin'","See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,"So uhh, how's the palace?"
Joey Tribbiani,You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?,"Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news."
Joey Tribbiani,Wow.,"Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, now it's a spare room?","Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare."

Joey Tribbiani,Eddie.,Morning.
Joey Tribbiani,"Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?","Oh it's uh, over there on the table."
Joey Tribbiani,You don't keep it over here on this table any more?,"No, Eddie likes to keep it over there."
Joey Tribbiani,Huh.,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.","Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good."
Joey Tribbiani,So how you two gettin' along?,"Oh, I couldn't be happier."
Joey Tribbiani,"Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.",There's another carton right over there.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.","Alright, so what's it about?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?",Well I like both eggs equally.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.,"Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.",God that is good TV.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",I'm sorry man.
Joey Tribbiani,Hello.,"Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey no problem.,See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Joey Tribbiani,"Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...",Welcome home man.
Joey Tribbiani,A little foos?,Absolutely.
Joey Tribbiani,What happened to the foosball?,Ah that's a cantelope.
Joey Tribbiani,He paid a lot of money for it.,"I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.","So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.","Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'"
Joey Tribbiani,How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?,"Ok, this could be tough."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.","Ooh, you almost had it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .","You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car ."
Joey Tribbiani,No problem. Hey Chandler,I think they get it.
Joey Tribbiani,Ok.,There's the man.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.","Yeah, didn't he tell ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah.,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Nooooo.,"Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal."
Joey Tribbiani,Not a dad.,I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Joey Tribbiani,Who said it was for you?,Hhhiiii.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.","Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",Ok.
Joey Tribbiani,"Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Joey Tribbiani,Right this is staging.,"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area."
Joey Tribbiani,Quick volleyball question.,Volleyball.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?","Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you."
Joey Tribbiani,But don't you need experience for a job like that?,"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.,Well there you go.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.","Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",Weird world. Your kids?
Joey Tribbiani,I figure my character has kids.,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.","Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Joey Tribbiani,What a phony.,"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah Bing, what's that about?","It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday."
Joey Tribbiani,"Joseph's good, isn't he?","Well, I'm going to kill you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",Why?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.,Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Joey Tribbiani,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.","Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go."
Joey Tribbiani,"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.","I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.","Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife."
Joey Tribbiani,Karen.,"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did."
Joey Tribbiani,Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer."
Joey Tribbiani,Really?,"No freakshow, she's fictional."
Joey Tribbiani,"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.","Joey, no means no!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.",How do you not fall down more?
Joey Tribbiani,"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?","Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
Joey Tribbiani,Good morning.,"Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me."
Joey Tribbiani,B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.,"Nope, not this time."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, quite yankin' me.",I'm not yanking you.
Joey Tribbiani,This is Janice.,"Yeah, I know. She makes me happy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.",I'm not breaking up with her!
Joey Tribbiani,Wheel!,Of!
Joey Tribbiani,Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!,"You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?","No, Janice."
Joey Tribbiani,"Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.","You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?","Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.","Well, there you go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?","Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, what do you want me to say?",I want you to say that you like her!
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.","Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,What are you guys doing together?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.","Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
Joey Tribbiani,"But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.","Well, I guess that's something."
Joey Tribbiani,"No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.",Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.",Oh God!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.",Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.",Taste it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!","Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago."
Joey Tribbiani,What?,You're in my seat.
Joey Tribbiani,How is this your seat?,'Cause I was sitting there.
Joey Tribbiani,But then you left.,"Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back."
Joey Tribbiani,"What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.","The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat."
Joey Tribbiani,All right! You can have the chair.,Really!
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.",All right!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.",The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Joey Tribbiani,That's right! I'm taking the essence.,"Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room."
Joey Tribbiani,It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.","What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, opposite, is opposite!",He's got nothing!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.",Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Joey Tribbiani,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...,Oooo-ooh!
Joey Tribbiani,WHOAA!!,"See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?",Because the kids need new shoes.
Joey Tribbiani,Aww. Ohh!,"Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?",And that's how you bought it?
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!,"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.","Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you know about that?!","Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!","Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Joey Tribbiani,No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.",You're building a post office?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.",Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Joey Tribbiani,Her what?,"Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?","No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Calm down, do you want this unit or not?",I do NOT want this unit!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.",Fine!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.",What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,Why don't we just go on two.,Why two?
Joey Tribbiani,Because it's faster.,"Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, it's big!","Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.","Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?"
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what?,Umm?
Joey Tribbiani,I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.,I've got five bucks says you can't.
Joey Tribbiani,"Get out your checkbook, mister.","Oh, I think I have the cash."

Joey Tribbiani,"Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?",Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.",What gay thing?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Baywatch.,What's it about?
Joey Tribbiani,Lifeguards.,"Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?"
Joey Tribbiani,"They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?","Yeah, I'll go get one."
Joey Tribbiani,Cool!!,"Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,Booo!!,Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I-I might've said supergay.",You totally screwed him over.
Joey Tribbiani,I'd really prefer a mountain bike.,"Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.","That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.","All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.",Why not?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...",What is the thing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.",What?
Joey Tribbiani,They were in his office.,"Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm telling you man, I saw it.","Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?",Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, now we got a reason.",What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.",All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, what's a matter?",I talked to Janice.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God, is she going back to him?","She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!"
Joey Tribbiani,"What are you ah, what are you gonna do?","I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.","Come on, tell me."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.","What? What are you, what are you talking about?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Great, you can cover Chandler.","No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play."
Joey Tribbiani,Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.,That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.","Yeah, all right, I'll play."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, we have to pick captains.",And then Tineals.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.","Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,I think so.,"Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.","Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.","Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.","Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her."
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.,"Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.","Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!"
Joey Tribbiani,After!!,Before!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.","And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.",Fine with me.
Joey Tribbiani,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.,"Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her."
Joey Tribbiani,Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.,"Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!"
Joey Tribbiani,Thirty seconds left on the timer!,"Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I got great news!,"Run, Joey! Run for your life!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.","Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler!,Hello-dillillio!!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.,"Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!,"Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Come on!!,"Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses."
Joey Tribbiani,"Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.",It's gotta be the first one.
Joey Tribbiani,"Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.","Yep, I'm in a tree."
Joey Tribbiani,Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?,I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Joey Tribbiani,"You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",Where's Mary-Angela?
Joey Tribbiani,What's goin' on?,You're it! Now run and hide!
Joey Tribbiani,"What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?","I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!","Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again."
Joey Tribbiani,"No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.","Okay, absolutely!"
Joey Tribbiani,All right.,You've got it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Cookie, now you can punch him!",What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?,"I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer."
Joey Tribbiani,Who?,I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Joey Tribbiani,The what?,The abridgment.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I can dance, y'know.","Oh no, no, no, no."
Joey Tribbiani,Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.,"Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier."
Joey Tribbiani,The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...,"To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good."
Joey Tribbiani,"And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Joey Tribbiani,These little women. Wow!,"Your liking it, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.,"No, actually Laurie's a boy."
Joey Tribbiani,All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?,"Hmmm, that's very cool."
Joey Tribbiani,Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?,"No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?"
Joey Tribbiani,Morning.,Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Joey Tribbiani,Heard about the leg burnin' huh?,It came up.
Joey Tribbiani,Where have you been?,The doctor.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",Yeah! You wanna come?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, 10:30.",What time is it now?
Joey Tribbiani,4:30.,"Yeah all right, so we'll hang out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?",Yes. Vividly.
Joey Tribbiani,She was kidding about that right?,"Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so..."
Joey Tribbiani,"God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?","Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I don't know.",She was kidding.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,"She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.","Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there...."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?","Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?","Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",Why? What happened to him?
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.","He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her."
Joey Tribbiani,Awful! Horrible!,She was not good. Not good.
Joey Tribbiani,Ewwwww!,Uh-oh.
Joey Tribbiani,You think I need a new walk?,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.",Are you actually saying these words?
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe she killed him?,Let's go.
Joey Tribbiani,Can I see the comics?,This is the New York Times.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....","Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I had the opposite dream.","Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week."
Joey Tribbiani,You're smoking again?!,"Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still."
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?,My lighter's in there!
Joey Tribbiani,"Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?","Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.","Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Joey Tribbiani,Arrrghh!!,"Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I-I can't handle this, you guys.","Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.",Always illegal Joe.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.",That's not a state Joe.
Joey Tribbiani,"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!","Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
Joey Tribbiani,"God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'",I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?","I'm talking about you. You big, big freak."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.","Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.","I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.,"Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate."
Joey Tribbiani,Saw a girl with that vest.,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,I got you something! Open it! Open it!,Okay. It's a chicken.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, well no problem there.",Easy Lenny.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,How's she doing?,She?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?","I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.",Excuse me?
Joey Tribbiani,What?,I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?,You don't think I get up when you get up?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohhh, here it comes.","Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!,And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Joey Tribbiani,"That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...","I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.",I'll take her back tomorrow.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.,"I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.",Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Joey Tribbiani,"That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.","Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way."
Joey Tribbiani,What 'cha doing?,Having a swim.
Joey Tribbiani,What about the chick?,Chicks don't swim.
Joey Tribbiani,Are you sure?,I don't know. Should we try it?
Joey Tribbiani,Wait. Give him a minute.,"Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?",I had one.
Joey Tribbiani,The green bottle next to the shaving cream.,Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, so, what'd ya think?",Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Joey Tribbiani,I-I wasn't in that.,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.",Or... Dick.
Joey Tribbiani,Well?!,"Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
Joey Tribbiani,"And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.","Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are ""There are no rules."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?",What if Joey were president?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!","Excellent hole, Joe."
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.","Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain."
Joey Tribbiani,No?,"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
Joey Tribbiani,And I was tired from digging the huge hole!,And then Joey remembered something.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.","Joey kept screaming at me, ""Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!"" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming."
Joey Tribbiani,"How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.","You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!","All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.",Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!","All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
Joey Tribbiani,What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.,Nooo.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. What do you do?,I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...",Let it go!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.","Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails."
Joey Tribbiani,Pretty nice?,"You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
Joey Tribbiani,WHAT?!!,Are you all right?!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah...,What happened?!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!",What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!",So-You got in voluntarily?!
Joey Tribbiani,"I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?",BEND OVER?!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.,"Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!"
Joey Tribbiani,Huh?!,Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Joey Tribbiani,Just pickle.,"Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday."
Joey Tribbiani,No he doesn't!,"Two hours, that lasted!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!","Now, there's two reasons."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!","Thank you, Joey."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,"Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?","Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.",Right in there!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?","Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
Joey Tribbiani,It's 4:30.,"Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I see what's going on here.",You-you do?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! You don't like Kathy.,You got me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?",Yeah. Right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?",Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,I'll be right back. What was that?,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",I am pretending.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well then, do it better!","Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.","Yes, it is, at Office Max."
Joey Tribbiani,It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?,Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?,Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!""","All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?"
Joey Tribbiani,She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.,For three years?
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...","All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?",Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!,Where?
Joey Tribbiani,"Our place, the hall! I...",I got something for her. It's a book!
Joey Tribbiani,A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?,"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?","No, it came out to an even twenty."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,"Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.",Oh yeah? That's great!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!",Aahhuuhhh....
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey! Happy birthday.
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.",No he didn't.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!",Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .",Goodnight.
Joey Tribbiani,That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.,"Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",What?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!,Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,"Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you."
Joey Tribbiani,What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you."
Joey Tribbiani,You got all that from the back of her head?,"All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.",What happened?
Joey Tribbiani,"We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.",Why can't you tell her?
Joey Tribbiani,"'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-",Joey! Joey!!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?,I thought your time ran out.
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-","Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey dude, it's me.",Hey it's Joey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!",What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.",Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.",Oh yeah man. Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!,Hang on buddy!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?,I sure did.
Joey Tribbiani,Why?,"Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you're amazing.",Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Joey Tribbiani,"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?","Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.","Oh, I don't know."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.",You mean with Casey.
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.",Or Casey.
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, Kathy.",Could be Casey.
Joey Tribbiani,"No. No, Kathy.",Consider Casey.
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Samboucha Margarita?,Is that a real thing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.","Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something."
Joey Tribbiani,What's up?,"It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually."
Joey Tribbiani,You do?,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.",What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she broke up with me.","Oh uh, when?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.","Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?","Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.",Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.,"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do."
Joey Tribbiani,"But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...","See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is."
Joey Tribbiani,Who?,It's me. I'm the other guy.
Joey Tribbiani,What?,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and..."
Joey Tribbiani,And what?! Did you sleep with her?!,No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey Tribbiani,What?!! That's even worse!!,How is that worse?!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! But it's the same!,"Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!"
Joey Tribbiani,Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!,"You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
Joey Tribbiani,"Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!",Probably because...
Joey Tribbiani,Hello.,"Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hello.,"Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm..."
Joey Tribbiani,My folks.,"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...","Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.","Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
Joey Tribbiani,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!","All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!,Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler?,"The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!"
Joey Tribbiani,That doesn't sound like thinking to me!,Sorry!
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!,"Okay, okay, you got it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!","You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight."
Joey Tribbiani,So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?,Absolutely!
Joey Tribbiani,"He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!",So?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!",Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.","Man, this is..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.","Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!"
Joey Tribbiani,Really?!,"Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'll see you guys.",Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.,"Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then."
Joey Tribbiani,So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!,"Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! All right? Let's go!,And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!!!,All right!!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.","Yeah, all right."
Joey Tribbiani,"So, we're having fun, right?",Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Are you serious?!,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know.","Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.","Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,Sure! Where are the seats?,Wherever! I've got like 20!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.","I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. ""And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.",Great!! That's great!
Joey Tribbiani,She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.,I can check that for ya.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, what's that about?","And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.",Diet soda.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, the last thing...","Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!"

Joey Tribbiani,I took a shot.,You're shooting with Althea?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, we are not gonna...","All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds."

Joey Tribbiani,Guest.,Fancy guest.
Joey Tribbiani,I call Monica's room!,You can't just call Monica's room.
Joey Tribbiani,Did you see the size of the closets?!,I can't believe we live here!
Joey Tribbiani,That-that is a good trick.,"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.",Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.","Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this.","She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",Oh my God!!
Joey Tribbiani,How'd it go?,"Well, she wasn't sleeping with him."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't wanna.,Please?
Joey Tribbiani,I wanted to go to the strip club!,"I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over."
Joey Tribbiani,So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!,Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, what's going on?","Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!",Thanks!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey that's what all my relationships are like.,"Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it."
Joey Tribbiani,What-what-what is so funny?,"I said, ""Like what?"""
Joey Tribbiani,There was a seen in Footloose...,Flashdance.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...",She was a welder.
Joey Tribbiani,What is that?,Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.,Do we pay for this?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.",Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!",And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey Tribbiani,Then you go to Tokyo.,"All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,"I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault."
Joey Tribbiani,"Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!","What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"""
Joey Tribbiani,Noo! Nothing!,"Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn."
Joey Tribbiani,One.,Two.
Joey Tribbiani,That's kinda nice.,"Yeah, that's kinda a relief."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!!,We have free porn here!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, they're hanging out with Joey.""","Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.","Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot."

Joey Tribbiani,Someone you didn't make up!,"Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!","Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!","No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!"
Joey Tribbiani,It's not that bad.,"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you're just Bing?",I have no name.
Joey Tribbiani,No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.,"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.","All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,Yeah we do!
Joey Tribbiani,Come on!,"Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?","Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.",Where is Emily?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!","Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!","Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats."
Joey Tribbiani,It's the Knicks!,Screw the Knicks!
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa!,I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Joey Tribbiani,Huh.,And the Knicks rule all.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.","All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!",Yeah baby!
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!",No they didn't!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.","Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!",I KNOW!!!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.,What?
Joey Tribbiani,I don't want to move again!,"I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!"
Joey Tribbiani,That was one good minute!,Good night.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you should here me.","It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a ""Quit being a baby and leave me alone"" clinic!",They don't have those.
Joey Tribbiani,That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!,That's what I did. Wah-pah!

Joey Tribbiani,What?!,You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,I know I don't have too! It tastes good.,"Plus, you look cool."
Joey Tribbiani,I know. Ross is getting married.,"Phoebe is, making people."
Joey Tribbiani,Everybody's doing stuff!,"And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!"
Joey Tribbiani,We could climb Mt. Everest!,"No-no, not something stupid, something huge."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!","Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,"We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!"
Joey Tribbiani,We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!,Yeah baby!
Joey Tribbiani,We could get that Everest video though.,"Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!"
Joey Tribbiani,"And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.","Oh, well..."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Yeah.,But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Joey Tribbiani,Awful! Horrible!,She was not good. Not good.
Joey Tribbiani,Ewwwww!,Uh-oh.
Joey Tribbiani,It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!,"Well, You could, but... probably just the one time."
Joey Tribbiani,"I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!","If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?","Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!",You can be the best man when I get married.
Joey Tribbiani,What about me?! You-you just said I could!,"I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.,"Hey guys, what are you doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.","He just said, ""No strippers."""
Joey Tribbiani,Oh-oh!,"Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride."
Joey Tribbiani,"The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!",What?
Joey Tribbiani,The ring is gone!,"Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!",You slept with the stripper?
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...","Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?"
Joey Tribbiani,So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!,"He will, Joe."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!","Hey, come on, it's not your fault."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.","No, you should."
Joey Tribbiani,I gotta go check something over here.,What a baby.
Joey Tribbiani,What do you got there?,"Condoms, dude!"

Joey Tribbiani,Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?,"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I like it. Here you go.","All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I embarrass you?",How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.,"Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. Sorry!,"No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day."
Joey Tribbiani,Me too.,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!",I hope he did!
Joey Tribbiani,"That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.","Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself."

Joey Tribbiani,Can I ask you something?,"Uhh, no."
Joey Tribbiani,"Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?",No.
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?",Yes.

Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Ohh! Oh!!,"Joey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!,Yes. Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,How?! When?!,It happened in London.
Joey Tribbiani,IN LONDON!!!,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Joey Tribbiani,I guess I'm done.,Fun's over!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.",Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hello!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?",You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Joey Tribbiani,That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!,So you're really okay with this?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!","Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.","Yeah, we are so sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, look.",That's a pig.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!","Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.",Oh yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"You're fake laughing too, right?","Oh, the tears are real."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,Nothing.,You built a fort didn't ya?
Joey Tribbiani,Kinda.,"Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was"
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.",I hate this thing!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?",Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, the quiet down thing!",You mean this.
Joey Tribbiani,"Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?","All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.",Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,But it's available now! Isn't it?,"Yes, it is."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!,There we go!
Joey Tribbiani,"But hey, Ross, this place is available now!","Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!",Yes that was a nice place!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,"Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. Maybe pizza?,About Ross!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.","Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,You're kidding!,"You're kidding, no!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!",Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Definitely!,"Yes! Ross, you have to stay!"
Joey Tribbiani,All right!,"All right, buddy!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?",Are you aware that you're still talking?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!","It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's not like it sounds.",It's exactly like it sounds.
Joey Tribbiani,"It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!",I'm over here big guy.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, they're mine.",See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...",All this lying has been hard on us too.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!","Well, yeah actually."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!","No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?",Oh-I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...,"All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this."
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you!,Joey's a sex addict.
Joey Tribbiani,I slept with Monica.,Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.","Hello, Chandler Bing."
Joey Tribbiani,Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.,"Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!"
Joey Tribbiani,"But, I love you.","Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?",Why?
Joey Tribbiani,You're driving me crazy with that!,"Okay, I'll stop."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",You wanna play?
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.","Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",I'm intrigued.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.","Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.","Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!"
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't finish my five pages.,"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.,"Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.","The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.",When did that happen to you?!
Joey Tribbiani,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!,"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?",All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.",This took you all day?!

Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?","Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating.

Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!","When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",From a bullet!
Joey Tribbiani,I know it doesn't make much sense...,Much sense?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!","So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!","So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
Joey Tribbiani,No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,Really?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.",Thanks.

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh umm, not go.","All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! You ready to go?,"Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.","I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.",So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.","We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once."
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.",Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,You wanna eat? My treat!,Isn't that Ross's money?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?,I don't know.

Joey Tribbiani,What?!,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude you said, ""No!""","I also said, ""Yes!"""
Joey Tribbiani,You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?,No! Ahhh!!!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't believe this!,"Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
Joey Tribbiani,What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!,They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.,"Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break."
Joey Tribbiani,"Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.","Oh, you don't want me on the trip?"
Joey Tribbiani,Not if you're gonna be like this!,"All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!,"All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!"
Joey Tribbiani,Fine! Get out!,You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Joey Tribbiani,Get out!!,"All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.","Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!,Love your condoms my man.
Joey Tribbiani,"They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.",Why?! What happened?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.","No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, so close.",There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.",Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...","Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.",Whoa!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!","Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!",Good luck!
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!,I see.
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!,What?
Joey Tribbiani,My identical hand twin!,What's an identical hand twin?
Joey Tribbiani,"What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!",Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Joey Tribbiani,Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!,How?
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!","Again I must go back to, how?"
Joey Tribbiani,"This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?","Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, are you unsupporting me again?","No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!"

Joey Tribbiani,Sure! What's up?,Monica and I almost got married last night.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, ""Ross."" Do not say, ""Ross.""","Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,What are you doing?,The key's stuck in the lock.
Joey Tribbiani,I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.,It still doesn't work.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not finished.,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! You're pregnant!,"No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!","Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. ""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?"" ""Can't, its not there.""","Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,Not once did we do that.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!,"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?","Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.",Who was it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what's up?","Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
Joey Tribbiani,"But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.","""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.",Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Any good mail?,"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....","""Benefits lapsed."""
Joey Tribbiani,Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.,"Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year."
Joey Tribbiani,Let me see that!,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!","I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.","Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.,"That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?!,What's wrong with you?
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.",This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Joey Tribbiani,"No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!",That's a hernia.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.",I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.,But are you sure you can do this?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey-hey!,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,There's a lost and found? My shoe!,You left a shoe here?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.","Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!",Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Joey Tribbiani,"You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.",What equity investments?
Joey Tribbiani,So the Porsche guy took his car back.,But you found the keys to his clothes?
Joey Tribbiani,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?,That is true.
Joey Tribbiani,Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!,"Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me."
Joey Tribbiani,Right! And when is that due?,First of the month.
Joey Tribbiani,And that's every month?,"No, just the months you actually want to live here."
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhh.,"Okay, here is the phone bill."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!!,"That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?"
Joey Tribbiani,No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.,"It's not charity, Joe..."
Joey Tribbiani,"No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.","Okay uh, here's the electric bill."
Joey Tribbiani,This is how much we pay for electric?!!!,"Uh, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.,"Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
Joey Tribbiani,"What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, you're on.","Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.,"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000."
Joey Tribbiani,You serious?,Oh yes!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, get ready to owe me!",Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.","Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Nah, not my game.","Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what's it called?",Cups.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know how to play Cups.,"I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun."
Joey Tribbiani,All right.,"Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?"
Joey Tribbiani,A two and a five.,"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
Joey Tribbiani,Really?!,"Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?"
Joey Tribbiani,A four and a nine.,You're kidding right?
Joey Tribbiani,No. Why?,Well that's a full cup!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what did you have?","It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, wow, 700.",Not 700 exactly?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,Double it!
Joey Tribbiani,What?,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
Joey Tribbiani,Really?,"Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,What's wrong?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!",Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Joey Tribbiani,"The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!",Oh man!!
Joey Tribbiani,"And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.","All right, let's play one more hand! One more!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.",I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Joey Tribbiani,"It's him, not it!","No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!",When did I try to give you money?
Joey Tribbiani,"Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!",I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!","So, uh, wh-where ya from?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh God, yeah.",Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!,No-no
Joey Tribbiani,I Gotcha!!,Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Joey Tribbiani,"Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!","Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.","Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,"Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, neighbor come on in.","So, is Janine around?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, no, she's at dance class.",Can I check out what she did to my room?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.","Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already."
Joey Tribbiani,It is???,"Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?"
Joey Tribbiani,No.,"Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?"
Joey Tribbiani,No.,"No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.",Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm a man.,Defend yourself.
Joey Tribbiani,"Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.",Yeah let's head off to work.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.,"No thanks, Josephine."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, I love birds.",What is the matter with you ?!?
Joey Tribbiani,What?,"You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.",You're turning into a women.

Joey Tribbiani,"So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?","No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together."
Joey Tribbiani,Well then let me do it!,Joe...
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.","Y'know, we haven't found anybody else."

Joey Tribbiani,"Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... ""We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."" Eh? ""It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."" ""We too can share and love and have and receive.""",Should we call the spitter?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?",Yeah. O-okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!,"See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?","No, not us... Us!"
Joey Tribbiani,"""...by doin' it.""",Joe?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?",Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah baby!,And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.,But then later that night...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, dude I'm so sorry!",No! No! No!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?",They're in my bag over there.
Joey Tribbiani,Ah.,"Uh, could you leave me one?"
Joey Tribbiani,For just you?,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.",No I-I-I'm fine.
Joey Tribbiani,And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-,I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!",Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Joey Tribbiani,"What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!","Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, come on nothing even happened!","Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding..."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.",How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.",That's what you should say.
Joey Tribbiani,What?,When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Joey Tribbiani,Really? I can do it?,I'd love it if you would do it.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,But those are the words! Those exact words!
Joey Tribbiani,So are guys doing okay?,"Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important."
Joey Tribbiani,Food? Uh-huh gimme!,So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Chandler!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.","Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!",Really? Right across the street?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,When'd you meet her?
Joey Tribbiani,Two days ago.,Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Joey Tribbiani,Kristen Lang.,Bye!
Joey Tribbiani,Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!,Y'know I think we should invite them.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, ""Monica...",Monica...
Joey Tribbiani,"""...when I look back over our time together...""",Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?","Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
Joey Tribbiani,How?! When?!,It happened in London.
Joey Tribbiani,IN LONDON!!!,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,I have never known love like this.,You really like it?
Joey Tribbiani,"You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?",I do.
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? 'Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people.",What size shoes do you wear?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.","Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry.",Those aren't eleven and a half.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?,"Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives."
Joey Tribbiani,No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.,But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Joey Tribbiani,Nothing! It was something.,"Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?"
Joey Tribbiani,What secrets?,"Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper."
Joey Tribbiani,You'll tell me later?,You already know.
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?,We really...didn't get a chance to...
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.,Y'know who has a great video camera?
Joey Tribbiani,"No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not...",You're an actor!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes I did! I'm Chandler. Dude, what happened?",How is that me?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.",What question?
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?",There's no question.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.,You're going down.
Joey Tribbiani,"This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!",You went home with the waitress.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,And Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?",What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.",Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
Joey Tribbiani,How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.,"You're right, this is more fun."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, that-that's-that's me!",That's me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.","Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.","That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,Why would she do that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?",This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Joey Tribbiani,In a minute!,In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",Why me?!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! It's your bachelor party.,Which is why you should do it.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't want to. You do it!,You do it!
Joey Tribbiani,You do it!,"All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?"
Joey Tribbiani,I miss this.,I don't think we've actually done this before!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I-I miss hanging out with you.",Well we...we still hang out.
Joey Tribbiani,Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.,"Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?","Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.","Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, neither.","Oh my God, what's up?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!","Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?",Do you?
Joey Tribbiani,"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?",In London?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London."
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.",If that.
Joey Tribbiani,Why?,Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?",Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?,I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.",Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!",And here we go...
Joey Tribbiani,"Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?","Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl."
Joey Tribbiani,Then why do you throw like one?,Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure. ""Monica.""","So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",That's a good idea.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,"Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I just...I feel terrible.","Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.",Are you okay?
Joey Tribbiani,I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.,"I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!"""
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your...,We didn't play it!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Joey Tribbiani,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do...so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.",Nice work my friend.
Joey Tribbiani,One.,Two.
Joey Tribbiani,That's kinda nice.,"Yeah, that's kinda a relief."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!!,We have free porn here!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.",This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!
Joey Tribbiani,"The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?",That's still in there?!
Joey Tribbiani,How come you have two?,Well this one's for you.
Joey Tribbiani,Get out.,"No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",That's what they'll call us.
Joey Tribbiani,No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.,Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!",You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Let's play Bamboozled!,Bamboozled?
Joey Tribbiani,"I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?","Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?",Bogota.
Joey Tribbiani,"It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.",What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Joey Tribbiani,"I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.",Higher or lower than what?
Joey Tribbiani,This is embarrassing.,Can you believe how lame this is?
Joey Tribbiani,"No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.","This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris...Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?",Let me see that.
Joey Tribbiani,This one right here.,Triscadecaphobia.
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, fear of the number 13.",Fear of Triscuts?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.",Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
Joey Tribbiani,You-you must choose Mr. Bing.,"Either, it makes no difference."
Joey Tribbiani,"Choose, you jackass!",I'll take a card.
Joey Tribbiani,"In what John Houston film would you hear this line, ""Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!""",Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Joey Tribbiani,Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!,Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!,I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wise choice, how many rungs?",Six!
Joey Tribbiani,That noise can only me one thing.,Hungry monkey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, over to Chandler.",I'd like a Google Card.
Joey Tribbiani,Are you sure?,Yes! No! Google!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!",Nooo!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh-How come you're not going?",I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Joey Tribbiani,I thought you already have a job.,"And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies."
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!,That's what I do now.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.",So you're never actually going to pay me back?
Joey Tribbiani,"It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself.",I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna go shave.,"Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit."
Joey Tribbiani,A little tall.,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go.",It's just so glamorous.
Joey Tribbiani,You liked it? You really liked it?,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
Joey Tribbiani,Which part exactly?,The whole thing! Can we go?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.","I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?",I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Joey Tribbiani,You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later.,"Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Sleeping beauty!,Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?",I'm so sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?",What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!","You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?","I don't know, five hundred dollars?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?","Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's...",Do you want a calculator?
Joey Tribbiani,Please!,Here!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, what else?","Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes..."
Joey Tribbiani,Which we're still keeping under our hats!,Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
Joey Tribbiani,"What the hell are you talking about, ""The south will rise again man.""","Yes, money well spent!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!","Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food..."
Joey Tribbiani,You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!,But you said you were ready too.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?",Sure.
Joey Tribbiani,Dude I just did something terrible.,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",What?! Why does she think that?
Joey Tribbiani,Because it kinda looked like I did.,"Again, what?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.",As we all are at some point during the day.
Joey Tribbiani,It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!,Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Joey Tribbiani,I guess.,And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
Joey Tribbiani,I know! I know it's awful.,"Well, what did she say?"
Joey Tribbiani,She said yes.,Does Ross know?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?",Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I like that. Yeah.","If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.","Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!"
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.","Okay, look, just do it gently."
Joey Tribbiani,Why're you so tired?,"Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep."
Joey Tribbiani,"See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now.","Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct.","Hey, what you guys talking about?"
Joey Tribbiani,How long do you have to go for?,They said it could be up to a year.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.","I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.,Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, you see right thru me!!","Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!"
Joey Tribbiani,"So? Did have sex, right?",What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
Joey Tribbiani,"See ya. Well, this is just us.",Mhum.
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.,"Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?",Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
Joey Tribbiani,Seriously? She actually said that?,Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Joey Tribbiani,Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Without that, you just got ""lame with women"".",Ye....
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...",Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Heeeyy! Hey!,What are you guys talking about?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah....,So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Joey Tribbiani,Allright. See you later!,See ya!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?,How come?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!",Do you have any ideas?
Joey Tribbiani,Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.,So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?","We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.","Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!"
Joey Tribbiani,What?,There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...,Get there faster!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey dude, what's up?","Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
Joey Tribbiani,Did you take that tape?,"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?,Some girl...!?
Joey Tribbiani,She hot?,Yeah...!?
Joey Tribbiani,How did she get me to settle down?,"Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...",Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Joey Tribbiani,What? Whoo... What?,"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...",Why am I hearing cheering?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.",Football? Just football?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.",It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!,Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.,What are you going to do?
Joey Tribbiani,"I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.",Well you proved them wrong.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? Commercial Break.,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Joey Tribbiani,"I lie better then that, right?","So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?,What's up Joe?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?",Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!",Courtside? Oh my God.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.,That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.","Well, you're forgetting about the time difference."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!",What is he doing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.","All right. Well, I'll check the guest room."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.,There's nobody here Joe.
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?",I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?,"I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.",I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. Here's your ticket.,"Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid."
Joey Tribbiani,Where are you going?,Game's tomorrow night Joe.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.","OK, Pheebs, your turn."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?",Monica.
Joey Tribbiani,Got ya.,I never want to leave you again!
Joey Tribbiani,Mine's is to Lilian Myers.,I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. So where's Mon?,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
Joey Tribbiani,And you're not helping?,"I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping."
Joey Tribbiani,For a walk.,Oh. You mind if I join you?
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.",Your thoughts? Plural?
Joey Tribbiani,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!","I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
Joey Tribbiani,"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?","Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
Joey Tribbiani,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,Great novels?
Joey Tribbiani,"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.",Come on! Joe!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I need your help.","Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped.","I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
Joey Tribbiani,"You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!",It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures.","Ok. First of all, this is green!"
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell am I supposed to do!,"All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you."
Joey Tribbiani,"What, what.","Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his ""business"" partners."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!,"Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!","Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon.",Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!","Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate."
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you so much.,No problem.
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.",Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Your eyebrows look weird.,"""Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine."" So you just touch yourself for anything?"
Joey Tribbiani,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.,"No, no, no."
Joey Tribbiani,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.,What? Why?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.",Your family name is Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.","Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you."
Joey Tribbiani,I give you $ 500 for them!,What am I supposed to do with these?
Joey Tribbiani,We gotta get more of that.,You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Joey Tribbiani,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.,And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know.",What? What do you mean you know?
Joey Tribbiani,"Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.",Oh! Right.
Joey Tribbiani,That's the fastest I have ever thought!,"Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?,Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
Joey Tribbiani,Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.,Oh ok.
Joey Tribbiani,Err... Kind of.,I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.",What?
Joey Tribbiani,Something personal.,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Joey Tribbiani,Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!,It's over/Joe!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!",What are you doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,Look who's coming around!,Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
Joey Tribbiani,Did you get it?,One of the slots got filled.
Joey Tribbiani,By you!?,Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not really comfortable with these questions!,"Please, just do it!"
Joey Tribbiani,You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!,"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?","Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!","Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing. TV: ""Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53""",I got that!
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit! anybody got anything?,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that is so great about the job.","Thanks, man."
Joey Tribbiani,And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.,Really? What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.","Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?","Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.",I could fall asleep at a play.
Joey Tribbiani,"I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.","Uh, let's see, who do I hate?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Joey Tribbiani,So you're ruling out surrogacy?,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?","Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
Joey Tribbiani,"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",ah-ha!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?","Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.","Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. It's actually our first official date.,Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Joey Tribbiani,"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.",What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Joey Tribbiani,It's OK!,How can you be so confident?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!",Really? Like you have a routine?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.",Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.",You mean like this?
Joey Tribbiani,"NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.","Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice."
Joey Tribbiani,More foosball?,...and beer!!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?","Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
Joey Tribbiani,Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?,To the bathroom!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.,"You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..",I'm begging you stop.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!","Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.","Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... ""Dear baby adoption decider people...""",So excited about your letter!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.",I don't... uh... understand.
Joey Tribbiani,Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!,On every word?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.",And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Joey Tribbiani,Hi sweetie!,Is Monica not here?
Joey Tribbiani,No.,"Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!"
Joey Tribbiani,Cool!,"Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?","Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part."
Joey Tribbiani,"What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?","First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor."
Joey Tribbiani,"I can do that! ""Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..."" Oh, what's the product?",Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Any word on casting yet?,"Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.",Joe...
Joey Tribbiani,"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!",Fine!
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.,"Work, Joe!"
Joey Tribbiani,Damn it!,What am I gonna do now?
Joey Tribbiani,Just pass it to your boss!,"He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!"
Joey Tribbiani,What's up?,Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.,I'm sorry man.
Joey Tribbiani,"But, ehm... you watched the tape?","Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!"
Joey Tribbiani,You didn't watch the tape.,What!? Of course I did!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?","I'm not lying to you, I watched it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you lied again!",I watched it!
Joey Tribbiani,Keep going Pinocchio!,I did!
Joey Tribbiani,No you didn't!,"I'm telling you, I watched the tape."
Joey Tribbiani,You still here?,"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!",Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Joey Tribbiani,And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .,He really is a chameleon.
Joey Tribbiani,That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.,I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, what do you say?",Lying is wrong!
Joey Tribbiani,And?... AND?,I'm a pretty little girl.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?,Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?",Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.",Little people?
Joey Tribbiani,"Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...",AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?,"WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.","You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, two times that happened!","Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.",Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...",The cranberries...?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.","He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?",The floating heads do make a good point.
Joey Tribbiani,Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.,That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Joey Tribbiani,aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.,A little late for that.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!",Can you ever feel your ears?
Joey Tribbiani,It's really starting to hurt.,"Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!"
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!,"Come on guys, PUSH!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Come on!,PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I've got food all over me.",Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys ""R"" Us... She was in stock!",That is the exact same thing.
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!",And so incorrect!
Joey Tribbiani,You son of a bitch!,"Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!",You know that's not the reason Joe.
Joey Tribbiani,Dah!!,"But if we win, we get your apartment."
Joey Tribbiani,Everyday use.,Fancy.
Joey Tribbiani,Guest.,Fancy guest.
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.","That's okay, we understand."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!",You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Joey Tribbiani,"It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?","I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?",I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Joey Tribbiani,"Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ""ghe deu flooff New York City""?",Why would you say that?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys.,Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!",Damn it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.",What?
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.",Really? What changed your mind?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.","Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago."
Joey Tribbiani,What?,Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Joey Tribbiani,What? I get my own room?,You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?",No!
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit!,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Joey Tribbiani,You guys hear a ringing?,What the hell is this?
Joey Tribbiani,"Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!",Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute...","Yes, Joe?"
Joey Tribbiani,I really made you think about that thing uh?,"Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you."
Joey Tribbiani,Who's that dirty old lady?,Monica's grandmother.
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, wait, wait, wait...",What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.",Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Joey Tribbiani,This is so cool!,"I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...","We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!",Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!","Oh, don't worry, we'll find them."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!,"It's okay, it's just an egg roll."
Joey Tribbiani,Just put it on a plate and leave.,"Okay, let's find these birds."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! They're in the table!,"Well, that can't be good!"
Joey Tribbiani,We gotta get them out of there!,How?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?","Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.","Joey, wait! The ball!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh God! So what do we do?,I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.,No... It's all glued together.
Joey Tribbiani,Does that mean we have to bust it open?,I don't know. Maybe.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!,I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. ""Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine.""",Did that movie ever get made?
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.","And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Here goes.,What's the matter?
Joey Tribbiani,I need to say goodbye to the table first.,I understand.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?","I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, here we go. I can't do it.","Well, I can't do it either."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!","We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,You gonna buy a new one?
Joey Tribbiani,Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.,"Well, at least we got these little guys out."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,"Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.,"Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you."
Joey Tribbiani,What?,"Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room."
Joey Tribbiani,I could get a goose!,"You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.","I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?"
Joey Tribbiani,Has it always been purple?,"Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.",Sounds like a date to me.
Monica Geller,And they weren't looking at you before?!,"Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
Monica Geller,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.",Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Monica Geller,Yes!,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
Monica Geller,Absolutely.,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
Monica Geller,Whose little ball of paper is this?!,"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead."
Monica Geller,"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.","Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
Monica Geller,"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.","Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!"
Monica Geller,What?,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Monica Geller,"Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!",Oh! Yeah!
Monica Geller,I just... can't do it.,Boys? We're going in.
Monica Geller,What does she mean by 'involved'?,"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.","Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred."
Monica Geller,No. Not after what happened with Steve.,What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Monica Geller,Really!,"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, why is it unfair?","So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
Monica Geller,Hey. Where's Joey?,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?"
Monica Geller,I'm sorry..,"Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.","No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
Monica Geller,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?","Ross, ten o'clock."
Monica Geller,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.","Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
Monica Geller,You could do that!,Y'think?
Monica Geller,"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?",It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Monica Geller,Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.,What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Monica Geller,"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?","Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
Monica Geller,Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.,"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."
Monica Geller,He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?","Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.."
Monica Geller,Hello?,"Hey, it's me."
Monica Geller,It's Chandler! Are you OK?,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
Monica Geller,What?,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Monica Geller,I have no idea what you just said.,Put Joey on the phone.
Monica Geller,"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.","Yes, every single one of them."
Monica Geller,Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?,For an emergency just like this.
Monica Geller,"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...","Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go."
Monica Geller,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!",Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!","I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.",Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Monica Geller,Yes! And that would be a shut-down!,Shut-out!!
Monica Geller,"You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.",One more game?
Monica Geller,C'mon up.,"Oh, good. Rog is here."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.","If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
Monica Geller,"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.",Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Monica Geller,"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.","Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
Monica Geller,It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.,Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Monica Geller,"Okay, look, this could be a really long game.",Your sister Ursula.
Monica Geller,I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?,"Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights."
Monica Geller,"Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.","Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?"
Monica Geller,Oh...,"""Happy Birthday Peehe."""
Monica Geller,A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?,Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Monica Geller,"Hey, guys.",Hey.
Monica Geller,That's because I'm in front of them.,Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Monica Geller,So have you called her yet?,"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?"
Monica Geller,That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!,"Hey, I've been honing!"
Monica Geller,"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.","I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
Monica Geller,Why don't you just take it with you?,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
Monica Geller,Why don't you just call her?,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
Monica Geller,Do you?,"No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
Monica Geller,Don't you have to pee?,'S'why I'm dancing...
Monica Geller,"Look at you, you won't even look at him.","Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me."
Monica Geller,He's... our age.,When we were?
Monica Geller,"No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.",And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Monica Geller,"Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?",Sorry.
Monica Geller,I want a baby.,"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
Monica Geller,Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.,"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
Monica Geller,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?,You'll get one.
Monica Geller,Oh yeah? When?,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
Monica Geller,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
Monica Geller,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?","No, no, no."
Monica Geller,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,"Uh, uh."
Monica Geller,Well?,Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Monica Geller,I can't believe he did this.,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
Monica Geller,"No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.",What about the time difference?
Monica Geller,From here to the airport?,Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Monica Geller,"Guys, you got your hair cut.","Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
Monica Geller,"Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.",People do stupid things when they're upset.
Monica Geller,Thank you. My hair is very amused.,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Monica Geller,"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?","Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
Monica Geller,So how was Joan?,I broke up with her.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.","Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake."
Monica Geller,You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.,"Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there."
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.",In a bad way?
Monica Geller,That's fine.,"Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing."
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.",I didn't know it was a big secret.
Monica Geller,All of us.,Together.
Monica Geller,It's work.,I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.",I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Monica Geller,There's my little boy.,Can I uh see something?
Monica Geller,What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?,"Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat."
Monica Geller,"Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!","That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!"
Monica Geller,"Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.","Hey, he's not crying."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.","Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time."
Monica Geller,"Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.",And we're changing.
Monica Geller,C'mon give me five more. Five more.,No.
Monica Geller,Five more and I'll flash you.,"One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them."
Monica Geller,"Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.","Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it."
Monica Geller,Why not?,Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Monica Geller,"OK, if you say stop, then we stop.","OK, stop."
Monica Geller,"No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.","OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret."
Monica Geller,"Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?","Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have."
Monica Geller,"Well, thanks.","I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work."
Monica Geller,"Well, you know.","You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.,And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Monica Geller,"Well no, but um.","I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all."
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .","So, you feel like goin' for a run?"
Monica Geller,Alright.,"Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here."
Monica Geller,OK. Just for a little while.,OK.
Monica Geller,What?,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up."
Monica Geller,Yeah. You!,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?"

Monica Geller,"You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?",Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

Monica Geller,"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",Yes!
Monica Geller,"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.","Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks."
Monica Geller,"All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!","Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles."
Monica Geller,"All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All right, ball the melon.","Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon."
Monica Geller,"I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.","Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?"
Monica Geller,Yeah.,"Well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
Monica Geller,"Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.","Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac."
Monica Geller,Excellent!,Very informative!
Monica Geller,"And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.","And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard."
Monica Geller,What did you say?,"Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.","Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained."
Monica Geller,"Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.","Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
Monica Geller,Tonight?,"Hey, yo."

Monica Geller,"Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.","Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?"
Monica Geller,Why?,Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Monica Geller,Alright.,"Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way."
Monica Geller,"Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.",It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Monica Geller,Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!,"Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching."
Monica Geller,I wa-,Uuuh.
Monica Geller,Are you sure this time?,"Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!"
Monica Geller,"Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.","Well, how do you find clothes that fit?"
Monica Geller,C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.,"I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings."
Monica Geller,So'd you guys have fun?,Your boyfriend is so cool.

Monica Geller,Could not be more terrified.,"Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum."
Monica Geller,"What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?","Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old."
Monica Geller,"Well, who's voice was that?","Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's."
Monica Geller,"Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....","You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, fine.","They got a phone in there, right?"
Monica Geller,"I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.","Well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
Monica Geller,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.","That, that's what's stupid."
Monica Geller,"Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.",You mean there's more than one of us.
Monica Geller,"What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?","I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid."
Monica Geller,That is never good.,Then I got all needy and clingy.
Monica Geller,Ohh!,Oh God.
Monica Geller,Welcome to our side of the tunnel.,This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Monica Geller,"Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.","Okay, okay. So, should I call her?"
Monica Geller,"My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.","I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?"
Monica Geller,"No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.","All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list."
Monica Geller,"So, Chandler, who's on your list?","Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit."
Monica Geller,What's the matter?,"Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish."
Monica Geller,He's retiling my floor.,Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Monica Geller,"Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.",He started mine first!
Monica Geller,It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?,"What, like a number?"

Monica Geller,"Thank you soo, much.","Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work."
Monica Geller,Hey.,Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Monica Geller,Help yourself.,You okay?
Monica Geller,Phoebe moved out.,Right.
Monica Geller,"I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?","Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend."
Monica Geller,"Well, I think so.","Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life."
Monica Geller,"I know, it is isn't it?","No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.","Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."
Monica Geller,"Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.","Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be...."

Monica Geller,"All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.",Wow! Just like in the pros.
Monica Geller,Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!,"Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!"
Monica Geller,Oh God!,"So, how many have you sold so far?"
Monica Geller,"Honey, what's the matter?",I just saw Janice.
Monica Geller,It's Joey's birthday.,"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
Monica Geller,Stick out your tongue.,Take off your shirt!
Monica Geller,"How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.",Hi Joey's sisters!
Monica Geller,How ya feelin'?,"Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it."
Monica Geller,What is the worse part?,I can't remember which sister.
Monica Geller,"Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.",Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Monica Geller,"No, no, no, that's Dina.","You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!"
Monica Geller,That was me.,"Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.",Bye-bye.
Monica Geller,Hi!,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.","Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."

Monica Geller,"Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.","Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.,"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world."
Monica Geller,"Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!","That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, no thanks.","Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of."
Monica Geller,We were just waxing our legs.,Off?!!
Monica Geller,What?,"Nothing, nothing."
Monica Geller,Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!,"He has sex, and we get hit in our heads."
Monica Geller,Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?,We are. He's meeting us here.
Monica Geller,Chandler!!,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Weren't you nine?!,"Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time...."
Monica Geller,Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?,Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Monica Geller,No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.,"Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo."
Monica Geller,Chandler!!,At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Monica Geller,Then why are you smoking?,Well it's very unsettling.
Monica Geller,"Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?","No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no."
Monica Geller,Hey.,"Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?"
Monica Geller,Here you go.,Thanks
Monica Geller,"As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.",Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
Monica Geller,That's Bill Clinton.,Who's he huggin'?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?,This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Monica Geller,"Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?","Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything."
Monica Geller,I know!!,"Okay, then get the lobster!"
Monica Geller,"Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.",Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Monica Geller,Two.,Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Monica Geller,Oh.,"Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you."
Monica Geller,"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Monica Geller,Really? Who's number two?,Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Monica Geller,"Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.","Yeah, and I don't have any cologne."
Monica Geller,We're kidding!,"Ross, don't. Ross!"
Monica Geller,"I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.","Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean."
Monica Geller,"No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.",I-kea! This is comfortable.
Monica Geller,"Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.","So, what do you thing the good news is?"
Monica Geller,"Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.","Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing."
Monica Geller,Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.,"You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook."
Monica Geller,Thanks!,"Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend."
Monica Geller,Yeah right.,Why is that so funny?
Monica Geller,You made a joke right? So I laughed.,"Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?"
Monica Geller,"Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!","Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like ""Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."""
Monica Geller,Huh?,I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Monica Geller,You didn't even take off your pants.,"Yeah, well, lucky for you."
Monica Geller,What?,I don't know.
Monica Geller,That's that weird voice again.,"Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!"
Monica Geller,Shoot! We're out of soda.,"Oh, I'll go out and get you some."
Monica Geller,Really?!,"Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?"
Monica Geller,Ennnh.,I've got canned goods.

Monica Geller,"No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!",They'll never understand!
Monica Geller,All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.,We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Monica Geller,Gin.,"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
Monica Geller,Will you stop!,Okay. All right.
Monica Geller,Gin.,"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
Monica Geller,Will you stop!,Okay. All right.
Monica Geller,"He is right, isn't he?","Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! What happened?,"Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!"
Monica Geller,"Hello, Chandler.",I love you.
Monica Geller,My God! Is this a gym card?,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times."
Monica Geller,Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.,Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Monica Geller,"Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?",I could die.
Monica Geller,"Just be yourself. But, not too much.",Wish me luck.
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, I like Kathy.","Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.",Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Monica Geller,"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?","Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?"
Monica Geller,"Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.","Really, bitchin'!"
Monica Geller,Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!,I kissed Kathy.
Monica Geller,He loves you.,Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Monica Geller,I remember you did.,God!! What am I gonna do?!
Monica Geller,"Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.","Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase."
Monica Geller,Who cares? He works in a museum!,"Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.",Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Monica Geller,"No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!",He's really picky about his patients.
Monica Geller,And Rachel. And that's Chandler.,How do ya do.
Monica Geller,"Come on, no peeking!",Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Monica Geller,Oh.,"Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?"
Monica Geller,"I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.","Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss."
Monica Geller,"No, you messed it up. You're stupid.",So what job did you get Joe?
Monica Geller,In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...,"Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking."
Monica Geller,And the sex?,"All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level."
Monica Geller,Then what is it?,"Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey."
Monica Geller,"So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.","We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
Monica Geller,"Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.",Yeah?
Monica Geller,Go on.,"All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys."
Monica Geller,Hey!,Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Monica Geller,"So, did you do it?","Yes, yes, we had the sex."
Monica Geller,"Uh-oh, it was bad?","It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, ""I see you point, I'm all right with it."""
Monica Geller,"All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...","Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!"
Monica Geller,"Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!",There are seven?!
Monica Geller,It's kind of an important one!,"Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down."
Monica Geller,"Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.",That-that's bad?
Monica Geller,What kind of changes?,Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Monica Geller,I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.,Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Monica Geller,"Aww, man!",All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Monica Geller,I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!,"Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong."
Monica Geller,Viva Las Gaygas!,Unfortunately that is correct.
Monica Geller,"You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.","I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you."
Monica Geller,"Huh, wanna bet?","Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far..."
Monica Geller,Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!,"Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice."
Monica Geller,"Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!",I knew it!
Monica Geller,Are you sure?,"Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's..."
Monica Geller,Hey! You're wearing pants!,That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Monica Geller,It's 9:30 in the morning!,They got a breakfast buffet.
Monica Geller,"Hello. Oh, hey Ross!","Ooh, let me talk to him!"
Monica Geller,"Oh-oh, my God!","Well, can I just..."
Monica Geller,"Shh!! Wait, what?",She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Monica Geller,A couple of days.,"Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!,"Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, come on, we can be guys!",No you can't.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?","No thanks, Mom!"
Monica Geller,Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.,"Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy."
Monica Geller,"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?","Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.","Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave."
Monica Geller,Come on! Chandler!,"Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them."
Monica Geller,Really?!,I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Monica Geller,That's-that's not Phase Three.,"Well, I'm there too!"
Monica Geller,"Wait, now, what am I doing again?","Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!"
Monica Geller,Janice?!,Isn't this amazing?
Monica Geller,"And lucky means, more cleavage?",Does for me.
Monica Geller,"Well at least, I'm going to mute it.",Oh no-no-no!
Monica Geller,It is not over! You're over!,What?
Monica Geller,You know!,Okay. Good one.
Monica Geller,"Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?","Uhh, a T-shirt that says, ""I don't belong here."""
Monica Geller,What do you say?,"Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!"
Monica Geller,Have you even had a girl up here?,"No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time."
Monica Geller,"All right, so what do you say?",No!
Monica Geller,"Oh, just do it!!","Op, op, I'm convinced!"
Monica Geller,"You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?","Fine, let's do it."
Monica Geller,Okay. Four.,That's a low one!
Monica Geller,I don't know!,Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
Monica Geller,"We'll discuss it, in the morning!",What the hell is going on?!
Monica Geller,"No, we're not! We're not leaving!","Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!","Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!"
Monica Geller,He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.,"Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!"
Monica Geller,Okay.,"Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!"
Monica Geller,"So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?","Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me."
Monica Geller,"No, seriously.","Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious."
Monica Geller,I can't believe he did this.,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
Monica Geller,"Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.","Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
Monica Geller,"Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!",Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, okay, give that a try!",All right! Let's do it!
Monica Geller,Umm...,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Monica Geller,I was laughing.,Out loud?
Monica Geller,Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.,So how are you doing?
Monica Geller,Then why would he say it?,Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Monica Geller,"Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.","Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?"
Monica Geller,Nope.,"So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?"
Monica Geller,"Yep, yep...You?","Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you."
Monica Geller,Well...I'd better get going.,"Oh yea yea, absolutely."
Monica Geller,Could you not look?,I don't want to look.
Monica Geller,Stupid.,Totally crazy stupid.
Monica Geller,What were we thinking?,"I'm coming over tonight though, right?"
Monica Geller,Hey.,"Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship."
Monica Geller,I know. How could we have let this happen?,Seven times!
Monica Geller,"Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...","In a foreign, romantic country..."
Monica Geller,I blame London.,Bad London!
Monica Geller,"So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?","Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it."
Monica Geller,Only here.,"Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs..."
Monica Geller,I'll meet you there in two minutes.,Okay!
Monica Geller,Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?,"Forget it, that's off."
Monica Geller,That's true.,The man's got a point.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!","Oh, hello Rachel."
Monica Geller,"Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?","Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes."
Monica Geller,You really think this is okay?,"Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it."
Monica Geller,"Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.","Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser."
Monica Geller,Okay!,Okay!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I think you should keep looking!","Yeah, for about 30 minutes."
Monica Geller,Or 45.,"Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice."
Monica Geller,"Well, it's getting late.","Yeah, we're gonna go."
Monica Geller,"Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.","Yeah, it's a very large plane."
Monica Geller,"I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?","We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it."
Monica Geller,"Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.","Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters."
Monica Geller,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?",'Kay!
Monica Geller,"Well, we certainly are alone.","Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule."
Monica Geller,"Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...",Right.
Monica Geller,"Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.","Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?"
Monica Geller,That's okay.,And I'm cute too.
Monica Geller,And you're cute too.,"Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack."
Monica Geller,Okay.,Bye.
Monica Geller,That counts!,"Oh, good!"
Monica Geller,Hey.,"Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship."

Monica Geller,"Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?","Uh, The Wheatsheaf."
Monica Geller,What took you so long?,"I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
Monica Geller,I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!,"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
Monica Geller,Do you know anything about women?,No.
Monica Geller,That's all right.,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.",That's right.
Monica Geller,That's what it sounded like.,All right...
Monica Geller,"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.","Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around."
Monica Geller,"Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.",Fine! Maybe I will too!
Monica Geller,"Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!","So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, great!","Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?"
Monica Geller,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.","Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this."
Monica Geller,I think you're better than you think you are.,"Really? Okay, so..."
Monica Geller,Know when to stop.,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.",Right!
Monica Geller,"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.","Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
Monica Geller,I might've said that. Why is that funny?,"Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!"
Monica Geller,Sure!,"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?"
Monica Geller,"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.","Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this."
Monica Geller,Hi Chandler.,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.","Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
Monica Geller,"William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.","Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, so?","Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.",Why?
Monica Geller,Why?,What's your point?
Monica Geller,Keep talking.,"I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD."
Monica Geller,Really?,"Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!"
Monica Geller,"Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?","Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on."
Monica Geller,"But, I just cleaned the bathroom.","Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."
Monica Geller,Ow!,Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Monica Geller,Never done that before.,Nope.
Monica Geller,Hi!,Hi!
Monica Geller,I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.,"I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time."
Monica Geller,All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.,"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing."
Monica Geller,"Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!","Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go."
Monica Geller,"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Monica Geller,"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!","Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere."
Monica Geller,We're switching rooms.,"Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!"
Monica Geller,"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?","Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!"
Monica Geller,We're switching rooms again.,What? Why?
Monica Geller,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?",Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,Chandler!,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!","I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
Monica Geller,"Okay, this one I like!",Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Monica Geller,Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?,"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!","Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
Monica Geller,"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",Do not speak ill of the dead.
Monica Geller,"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?","I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
Monica Geller,What did you say?,"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""
Monica Geller,"Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.","Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea."
Monica Geller,Chandler!,Monica.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.","Okay, fine, $300."
Monica Geller,300 dollars?!,"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!"
Monica Geller,Hi.,"I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it did.","So, I guess this is over."
Monica Geller,What?,"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
Monica Geller,"Why, exactly?","Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
Monica Geller,Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!,"So, this isn't over?"
Monica Geller,"You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.",Really? Okay. Great!
Monica Geller,"Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!",We're in a relationship?
Monica Geller,I'm afraid so.,Okay.
Monica Geller,Sorry.,Sorry.
Monica Geller,That's very nice.,"That's sweet, Joey."
Monica Geller,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.","Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians."
Monica Geller,"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.",Okay.
Monica Geller,"Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.","Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
Monica Geller,Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?,"Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef."
Monica Geller,"Well, I do.",I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Monica Geller,"Hi, Chandler.",Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?","You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!"
Monica Geller,"Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.",Okay.
Monica Geller,"Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.",Are you all right?
Monica Geller,I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.,That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Monica Geller,I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!,"Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I said I was sorry.","Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later."
Monica Geller,"Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?","Yeah, just leave me alone for a while."
Monica Geller,"Wait, wait, wait!","Look, Monica..."
Monica Geller,Look!,This is not going to work.
Monica Geller,I bet this will work!,You are so great! I love you!
Monica Geller,What?,"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
Monica Geller,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!,No I didn't!
Monica Geller,"Yes, you did!",No I didn't!
Monica Geller,You love me!,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Monica Geller,"We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.","I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships."
Monica Geller,We are! Help us!,Help!
Monica Geller,"Hey, Phoebe!","Hi, Pheebs!"
Monica Geller,We're so sorry.,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.",You're naked in this picture!
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?",And you're okay with that?
Monica Geller,I like them a lot.,"That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area."
Monica Geller,I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Monica Geller,"Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.","Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep."
Monica Geller,"Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?","Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party."
Monica Geller,I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.,"I know, I can do this."
Monica Geller,What was that?,What?
Monica Geller,That noise you just made?,"Oh, that was my work laugh."
Monica Geller,Really? Your work laugh?,"Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too."
Monica Geller,"All right, check me out.",Okay.
Monica Geller,Really?,"And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet."
Monica Geller,"Hey, I thought you already had one.","Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?"
Monica Geller,"Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!","Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game."
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.",Let them win one.
Monica Geller,"Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.",You're not even giving them a chance!
Monica Geller,I can't believe you let them win!,"Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it."
Monica Geller,I was frustrated.,It was my racquet.
Monica Geller,I was frustrated with you!,If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Monica Geller,"Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you around, Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first, Doug!"" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.","Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
Monica Geller,"Oh, none for me. Thanks.",Just a little bit of sugar.
Monica Geller,How does that laugh not give you a headache?,"Oh, you get used to it."
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.","So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
Monica Geller,I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.,Oh.
Monica Geller,"Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.",Really?
Monica Geller,"Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?","I think I do! Thank you, Monica."
Monica Geller,I thought you could use the help.,Coffee in a fight!
Monica Geller,Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!,But we're not ready to tell yet!
Monica Geller,That was a half an hour?,It's your timer.
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!","All right, then massage me up right nice!"
Monica Geller,"It's so good, isn't it?",It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Monica Geller,Say good-bye to sore muscles!,Good-bye muscles!!
Monica Geller,No he's not!,"Yes, he is!"
Monica Geller,What?!,"I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"
Monica Geller,No.,"Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em."
Monica Geller,"Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, ""I don't like your massages.""",I don't like your massages.
Monica Geller,See? It's no big deal.,"Okay, but now see you're crying!"
Monica Geller,I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.,What?
Monica Geller,My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.,"It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! You don't know me at all!,"Okay, you give the worst massages in the world."
Monica Geller,I'm crying here!!,"Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, ""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you."
Monica Geller,"Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?","Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!"
Monica Geller,"So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?",Absolutely!
Monica Geller,Okay. I suck!,Yeah!
Monica Geller,You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?,"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny."
Monica Geller,"Okay, now you're even cuter!!",Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Monica Geller,What?,"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me."
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?,I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Monica Geller,That's not possible!,Ow!
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.","Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.","No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!"
Monica Geller,This bicep?,Well it's not flexed right now!
Monica Geller,"Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?","Sure, I'll do it with ya."
Monica Geller,"Actually, I did!","Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",Are you serious?
Monica Geller,Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!,Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Monica Geller,"Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...","Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
Monica Geller,"All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!","Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?"
Monica Geller,"Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!",How do you know?!
Monica Geller,Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!,At this?!
Monica Geller,She's bluffing!,"Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!"
Monica Geller,You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!,"Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?"
Monica Geller,"Well actually, Ross doesn't.","Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?!,"Oh, I'm going on the lamb."
Monica Geller,"Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.","Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps."
Monica Geller,"I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?","Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up."
Monica Geller,Isn't this great?,Hmm.
Monica Geller,Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?,"Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever."
Monica Geller,Are you okay?,"Yeah, I'm cool. Casual."
Monica Geller,What-what are you doing?,"I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually."
Monica Geller,"Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",What?!
Monica Geller,Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.,"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?"
Monica Geller,Oh and you know what I want!,Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Monica Geller,I do not have baby fever!,"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!"
Monica Geller,"Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Monica Geller,You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!,"Well, I did not know that."
Monica Geller,"Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?",Monica.
Monica Geller,I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.,Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
Monica Geller,What?!,"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again."
Monica Geller,I'm Monica.,"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
Monica Geller,Okay.,"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this."
Monica Geller,Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!,Monica...
Monica Geller,"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",Will you marry me?
Monica Geller,"Chandler, why are you doing this?",I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Monica Geller,Chandler.,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Monica Geller,"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?","No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.","Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
Monica Geller,Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",I didn't think I was!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?","Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door."
Monica Geller,Wow!,"Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that."
Monica Geller,What's with him?,"Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter."
Monica Geller,No!,"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud."
Monica Geller,Um-hmm.,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?"
Monica Geller,"Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!","Hey Monica, here's your broom back."
Monica Geller,Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?,"Uh, yeah."
Monica Geller,Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.},Why?
Monica Geller,"'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!","Ohh, so?"
Monica Geller,So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!,"Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat."
Monica Geller,Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.,That was amazing.
Monica Geller,We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.,"No, you're the best."
Monica Geller,"No, you're the best.","No, you're the best."
Monica Geller,"You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?","Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean."
Monica Geller,Hi Chandler.,Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Monica Geller,Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?,"No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!"
Monica Geller,"Come on, we can't let them win!","Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!"
Monica Geller,Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!,So?
Monica Geller,I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.,Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Monica Geller,Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?,"Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now."
Monica Geller,Really?,"Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting."
Monica Geller,"That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.",Yeah?
Monica Geller,Yeah.,Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Monica Geller,Did not.,Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I freaked out a little.","Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back."
Monica Geller,Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!,You guys ready fore the movies?
Monica Geller,"Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.",I think you smell great!
Monica Geller,Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!,There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Monica Geller,Y'know...go! Go! Right there!,Thank you! Thank you!
Monica Geller,Hey! Happy Anniversary!,"Happy Anniversary, 10 months!"
Monica Geller,"So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...","Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there."
Monica Geller,Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?,The one that doesn't.
Monica Geller,That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.,"Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?"
Monica Geller,That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.,Okay.
Monica Geller,"It's no big deal, I do it all the time.","So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?"
Monica Geller,Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!,"Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, this actually bothers you?","Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it's good.","See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.","Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women."
Monica Geller,"Go on, teach me something about men and women.","Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"""
Monica Geller,No way!,It's true.
Monica Geller,Well that's pathetic!,Again true.
Monica Geller,And this goes for all guys?,All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Monica Geller,Hi!,You ready?
Monica Geller,Yeah.,You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Monica Geller,"Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.",Let me see the earrings.
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, the earrings...",They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Monica Geller,"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Monica Geller,No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.,Okay.
Monica Geller,Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!,"Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!"
Monica Geller,That is so sweet!,"Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem."
Monica Geller,No-no! Don't do it! Don't!,What?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.","Yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
Monica Geller,Please! I made this game what it is.,Not fun anymore?
Monica Geller,"Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!","Okay, so Richard, Richard!"
Monica Geller,Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.,Thank you.
Monica Geller,I wanna say good-bye at the car!,Okay!
Monica Geller,"Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.",That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Monica Geller,It's almost our anniversary!,I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Monica Geller,I got you a present!,"Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
Monica Geller,"I know, but you have to open it today!",Okay.
Monica Geller,Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!,Wow!
Monica Geller,"For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.",Do we have to?
Monica Geller,No.,"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
Monica Geller,"Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!","Yeah, I think we should see other people."
Monica Geller,"But we can go, right?",Yes.
Monica Geller,Okay!,It's a great idea.
Monica Geller,Aww! I love you!,Can I give you a present now?
Monica Geller,Okay!,Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Monica Geller,"I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!","How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?"
Monica Geller,"Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.",Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.",I'm not mad.
Monica Geller,Really?!,"Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal."
Monica Geller,"It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?",When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Monica Geller,You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.,Thanks.
Monica Geller,"I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.",Next time?
Monica Geller,"I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!","That's so funny, because I think I just did!"
Monica Geller,"Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.",Fine with me!
Monica Geller,No it is not!,What are you talking...
Monica Geller,"All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!",See you later Mon.
Monica Geller,"Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!",What does it look like? I'm going home.
Monica Geller,"What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!",Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Monica Geller,Not any more.,Really?!
Monica Geller,"Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.","Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.","Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love."
Monica Geller,A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!,Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Monica Geller,"That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?","Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?"
Monica Geller,Pick a number! That is your only job!,8. 8!
Monica Geller,Thank you!,"If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!"
Monica Geller,We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?,Noo!
Monica Geller,"Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?","Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8."
Monica Geller,What?,Two fours.
Monica Geller,"All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!",Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?",Another hard 8.
Monica Geller,Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!,"Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight."
Monica Geller,What did you just say?,You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Monica Geller,Are you serious?!,Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Monica Geller,I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.,"Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?"
Monica Geller,Okay!,Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Monica Geller,"Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",All right!
Monica Geller,"Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.","Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
Monica Geller,You're so efficient. I love you!,Let's go!
Monica Geller,No-no-no! We need something old!,"Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve."
Monica Geller,That'll work!,I don't think so.
Monica Geller,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",Here just...take this.
Monica Geller,That's stealing!,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
Monica Geller,Ohh.,"Okay, one thing at a time."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,"Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?"
Monica Geller,Whoa!,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Hey.,"So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?"
Monica Geller,"So, what do you think we should do?",I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Monica Geller,I know I love you!,So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Monica Geller,"That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!","Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married."
Monica Geller,"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.",Sounds great.
Monica Geller,Ready?,Ready!
Monica Geller,Come on eight.,"Yes, yes eight."
Monica Geller,Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.,"That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess."
Monica Geller,Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.,"That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!"
Monica Geller,I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?,"Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?"
Monica Geller,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,Well you did pull his hair.
Monica Geller,He took my snack!,I'm not getting into this again!
Monica Geller,"Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.","Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay."
Monica Geller,"This doesn't mean anything, does it?",No!
Monica Geller,"I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!",Me too!
Monica Geller,I don't want things to change! Do you?,No!
Monica Geller,"All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!","Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!"
Monica Geller,Then all your stuff would be here.,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
Monica Geller,"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.",Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Monica Geller,Live together? There have been no signs for that.,Me asking is kind of a sign.
Monica Geller,YES!!!!!!!!,Okay!!!!!
Monica Geller,Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!,Okay.
Monica Geller,Here's your key,Oh thanks.
Monica Geller,"Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!","The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!"
Monica Geller,Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!,This is not a sign!
Monica Geller,"No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!",It's an old key!
Monica Geller,Oh my God it's old!,I love you!
Monica Geller,I love you!,Are you hugging the door right now.
Monica Geller,No.,"Yeah-yeah, me neither."
Monica Geller,Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?,"No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict."
Monica Geller,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?","No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too..."" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""...go to the bathroom."" He may think I'm sick."
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.","Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?"
Monica Geller,Pretty much.,All right.
Monica Geller,"Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!",What gave me away?
Monica Geller,"I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!","Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?"
Monica Geller,No.,Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Monica Geller,"Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!","Well, Joey's my best friend."
Monica Geller,I'm not your best friend?,You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Monica Geller,"All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.",Okay. Oh yes.
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey-hey!
Monica Geller,These aren't for you! Are you upset?,I am now!
Monica Geller,Hi.,Hey!
Monica Geller,"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.","Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?"
Monica Geller,"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.",And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Monica Geller,"Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",Sure!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.","Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!"
Monica Geller,No.,"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."""
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.","So, that's it?"
Monica Geller,I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Monica Geller,What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,"I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
Monica Geller,Are you mocking me?,"No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room."
Monica Geller,Hi.,"Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women..."
Monica Geller,Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.,Really?
Monica Geller,Yeah! Oh yes!,Ohh.
Monica Geller,"Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Monica Geller,Oh good.,"Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?"
Monica Geller,Changes?,"Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair."
Monica Geller,You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?,Is that a problem?
Monica Geller,"Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.","Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over."
Monica Geller,See now-now you're taking them away from their home.,"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!",In the game room!
Monica Geller,Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Monica Geller,Love is the best medicine.,That's laughter.
Monica Geller,Why do you do it?,I don't know.
Monica Geller,That's very funny!,"He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
Monica Geller,You still want to move in together right?,Of course!
Monica Geller,Ross didn't scare you?,Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Monica Geller,"Come here, I want to show you something!",Okay!
Monica Geller,This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.,Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Monica Geller,Okay!,"Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?"""
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.,"Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!"
Monica Geller,Oh my God! I love that!,Really?!
Monica Geller,Hey!,"Oh, what's the matter?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!","Yeah, all right."
Monica Geller,"Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.","Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies."
Monica Geller,"Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.","Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too."
Monica Geller,What do you mean?,"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around..."
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.",You don't even have a car!
Monica Geller,"I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.",And?
Monica Geller,And six others.,There you are.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.","Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!",He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Monica Geller,How are you still single?!,All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Monica Geller,Good. What made you change your mind?,I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Monica Geller,But my apartment!,Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Monica Geller,But the mess!,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Monica Geller,"You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!","Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!"
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Monica Geller,Okay.,"Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?"
Monica Geller,"Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...","Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey."
Monica Geller,I thought you said you were going to do nothing.,"Yes, but for the last time."
Monica Geller,"It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?",He's at a dinner party.
Monica Geller,She really left.,I know.
Monica Geller,Thank you.,No problem roomie.
Monica Geller,Can I ask you a question?,Sure!
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!",I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Monica Geller,"Oh, So you can move them!","Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you."
Monica Geller,"Oh, so you like her too Chandler?","Hey, look at all the boxes!"
Monica Geller,Hi!,"Hey Mon, how's it going?"
Monica Geller,"Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.","Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
Monica Geller,It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.,No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Monica Geller,"Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?","It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me."
Monica Geller,Is it the same thing that Chandler had?,"Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later."
Monica Geller,"Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!",Bye! Thank God
Monica Geller,Is it okay for me to come in now?,Uh-huh
Monica Geller,"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.","Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Monica Geller,"Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.",Really?
Monica Geller,Of course!,Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Monica Geller,Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.,Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Monica Geller,Hey guys.,"Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?"
Monica Geller,It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.,"Ohh, yeah."
Monica Geller,"Ross they're really, really, really white.","Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth."
Monica Geller,She will be after tonight.,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.","Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.","Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish."
Monica Geller,Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.,"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's."
Monica Geller,"Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.","Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple."
Monica Geller,"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.","Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing."
Monica Geller,Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.,You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.","Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers."
Monica Geller,"Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?",Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Monica Geller,"I miss Rachel. No, my parents.","Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!"
Monica Geller,Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?,Why haven't you told them?!
Monica Geller,"Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.",Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Monica Geller,So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.,Why wouldn't they be happy?
Monica Geller,"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.",What? What? Why?!
Monica Geller,"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Monica Geller,"Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.","Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em."
Monica Geller,You really think that'll work?,"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?"
Monica Geller,"Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!","Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father."
Monica Geller,Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!,Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Monica Geller,"Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!","The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!,"Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God!,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?",That's what you got me?
Monica Geller,I can't do it!,"Now you do that, you're on TV."
Monica Geller,You serious?!,That's great!
Monica Geller,"I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!","Look at us, we're a couple of couples!"
Monica Geller,The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.,"And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night."
Monica Geller,What?!! What?,So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Monica Geller,"Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!","And I am not blah, I am a hoot!"
Monica Geller,"Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.",Okay.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?",Perfect decibel.
Monica Geller,"I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!","And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, ""Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."""
Monica Geller,No.,Seriously?
Monica Geller,"She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.","He took my joke, he took it."
Monica Geller,It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.,"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
Monica Geller,That's a good idea.,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Do you know what's a bad idea?,Picking Rachel.
Monica Geller,That's right. Did you hear something?,Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Monica Geller,Why do I have to decide?,Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Monica Geller,"Okay, Chandler, you go first.","Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
Monica Geller,"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",Can I finish my story?!
Monica Geller,Continue.,"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up."
Monica Geller,"Hi, Chandler. There you are.","Hi, oh hi."
Monica Geller,"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Monica Geller,"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",You're a little high maintenance.
Monica Geller,Ahhh! You are on my list.,"I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you."
Monica Geller,I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.,I'm off the list.
Monica Geller,I have not been sick in over three years!,I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Monica Geller,"Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!","I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.",That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Monica Geller,Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?,"Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy."
Monica Geller,Come on.,Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Monica Geller,"I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.","That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe."
Monica Geller,Chandler!,"Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!"
Monica Geller,"Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.","Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep."
Monica Geller,How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.,I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Monica Geller,"Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.",Would you please get some rest!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I think I'm sick.",Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Monica Geller,"Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?","No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way."
Monica Geller,Come on! I really need your help!,No-no-no-no-no!
Monica Geller,"Fine, I'll rub it on myself.",Okay.
Monica Geller,Yeah?,It's nice.
Monica Geller,Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?,Yes!
Monica Geller,I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?,"It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?"
Monica Geller,"Not now, I'm sick!",Oh come on you big faker!
Monica Geller,What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?,Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Monica Geller,"Okay, if you really wanna have sex...",Okay!
Monica Geller,Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.,I'm not macho.
Monica Geller,Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.,"No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy."
Monica Geller,Where were your parents?,Oh they didn't want to come!
Monica Geller,"This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.","Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn."
Monica Geller,Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?,Her ankle is what you're watching?
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie!,Hey!
Monica Geller,Chicken Soup for the Soul?,There's no back to this couch!
Monica Geller,Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside."
Monica Geller,"Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.",Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Monica Geller,Stop it!,"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this."
Monica Geller,"I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.",Yeah?
Monica Geller,"Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.","Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then."
Monica Geller,"And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.","Aww, I love you so..."
Monica Geller,What is wrong with you?!!!,What?!
Monica Geller,"What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!",So you didn't mean any of that?!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Are-are you crying?,I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Monica Geller,Bye.,"I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate."
Monica Geller,"And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.",Sure I would!
Monica Geller,Oh no! What's the matter?,"Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not ""Archie Comic funny."""
Monica Geller,You realize what you are don't you?,What?
Monica Geller,"Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.","I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead."
Monica Geller,Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?,"Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, ""Bring me food."" Two is, ""I'm with a girl, bring us food."" Three is, ""I'm lost and I can't find food."""
Monica Geller,Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!,Aww.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, me too.","Well, I could make it seem like he's here. ""Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."""
Monica Geller,Stop it!! That's not funny!!,Okay.
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.",What was tonight?

Monica Geller,Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?,Okay.
Monica Geller,I was kidding.,So was I.
Monica Geller,No! Oyster?,"Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you."
Monica Geller,"Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?",I do like that.
Monica Geller,It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!,"Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?"
Monica Geller,Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.,Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!

Monica Geller,"Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?",I have some moves.
Monica Geller,"I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.","Yeah, let's just forget it."

Monica Geller,Hey!,Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Monica Geller,"Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!","So you uh, want to do something tonight?"
Monica Geller,Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.,"Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when..."
Monica Geller,Are you okay?,"Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?"
Monica Geller,"Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, ""Can the doctor see me now?""",I bet he can.
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?","Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.","Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
Monica Geller,What?!,I'm the ruptured spleen.
Monica Geller,Why would you do that?,Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Monica Geller,Really?,"Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend."
Monica Geller,Chandler!,"I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a ""doctor..."""
Monica Geller,"There was just one woman, wasn't there?","No, there were two."
Monica Geller,Including me?,Oh yeah.
Monica Geller,Hey!,"Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?"

Monica Geller,"Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!",Okay!
Monica Geller,"Okay, you ready to open yours?",Yeah!

Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!","Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape."

Monica Geller,We have got to wash that!,Yeah!
Monica Geller,"Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?",You have done enough!
Monica Geller,I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!,"No you don't-get it in black, not brown."
Monica Geller,"Oop, your cake is ready!",Oop!
Monica Geller,"Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.","Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now."
Monica Geller,"I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.","Oh, the mixed tape."
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.,"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!","Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?"

Monica Geller,"Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?","Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time."
Monica Geller,"You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.","No, we only went out once."

Monica Geller,Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?,Am I naked again?!
Monica Geller,We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.,"Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?"
Monica Geller,Wh?! What about my allergies?!,"Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you."
Monica Geller,"Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...",Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Monica Geller,Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...,"You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?"
Monica Geller,Ross!!,Ross!
Monica Geller,Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?,There's a Mr. Bing!
Monica Geller,"No, you said the baby creeps you out.","No, the little girl creeps me out."
Monica Geller,You said the baby.,Why would the baby creep me out?

Monica Geller,"Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!",Hmm.
Monica Geller,Phyllis is sitting in a chair.,Oh.
Monica Geller,Phyllis sees what I'm doing.,Oh-oh.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",We said seven!
Monica Geller,We said six!,"The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six."
Monica Geller,"Hi, honey.",See you later.
Monica Geller,"What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!",Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Monica Geller,"Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!",This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
Monica Geller,"I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.","I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday."
Monica Geller,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?",Right here!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...","Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!"
Monica Geller,"It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.",Okay.
Monica Geller,Really?,"Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready..."
Monica Geller,I know! I know.,Okay.
Monica Geller,What's the big deal?,I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Monica Geller,"Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?","Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!"
Monica Geller,Hi guys.,You are beautiful.
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,"One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here."
Monica Geller,Are you okay?,Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Monica Geller,"Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?","Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?"
Monica Geller,Are you sure you're okay?,"Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you."
Monica Geller,Ohh that's sweet!,"Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with..."
Monica Geller,Oh my God!,"I know, but just let me say it."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, Richard.","What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?","Yeah, I'll sit down."
Monica Geller,Ohh.,What?!
Monica Geller,She's leaving for three months.,For camp!
Monica Geller,Okay.,What did you guys just do?!
Monica Geller,What are you up too?,"Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
Monica Geller,Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.,"Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
Monica Geller,Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!,Eh...
Monica Geller,"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?","Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but that's pigs not people!","If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%."
Monica Geller,Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?,"Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Monica Geller,Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!,"Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?"
Monica Geller,"Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!","It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica."
Monica Geller,"Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.",To Monica!
Monica Geller,Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.,Know what I mean?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but I don't think we have time.",There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Monica Geller,"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!","I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me."
Monica Geller,"I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.","Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris."
Monica Geller,Paris?,We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Monica Geller,Keep talking.,"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!"
Monica Geller,"Bonjour, monsieur.","Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away."
Monica Geller,"My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.","Ahh, third base."
Monica Geller,I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!,"Well, somebody should."
Monica Geller,"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!",How is that ever going to happen?!
Monica Geller,Oww!,What's the matter honey?
Monica Geller,Okay!,Already?!
Monica Geller,Okay!,What in God's name is that?!
Monica Geller,"A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.","Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know."
Monica Geller,"Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!",Okay.
Monica Geller,Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?,Centerpieces!
Monica Geller,Yeah! Roses or Lilies?,"Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! It's like one mind.,Uh-huh!
Monica Geller,I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,"I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood."
Monica Geller,How? I don't have any money.,"Well, I have some."
Monica Geller,How much?,"Well, close to..."
Monica Geller,"Ah, yeah!","Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
Monica Geller,This is the most special day of our lives.,"No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party."
Monica Geller,"Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.","Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no."
Monica Geller,You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?,"Yes, I am!"
Monica Geller,Hey.,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",Ehh.
Monica Geller,"Eh, you work for that.","Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
Monica Geller,You do?!,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do."
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?","Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
Monica Geller,You thought about that?,Yeah.
Monica Geller,How many kids were we gonna have?,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
Monica Geller,What else did you think about?,"Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",Sure you do.
Monica Geller,"No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.",You sure?
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.,I love you so much.
Monica Geller,"I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.","Oh yeah, totally!"
Monica Geller,"Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.",Really?
Monica Geller,Yeah!,"You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, I know I what I want!",What we want honey.
Monica Geller,Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.,Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Monica Geller,What?,"Nothing, I just like to go like this."
Monica Geller,He hates to lose.,"Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand."
Monica Geller,Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!,I know.
Monica Geller,You gave my father a lap dance!,Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Monica Geller,"Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!",I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Monica Geller,"Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.",It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie.,"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
Monica Geller,I can't tell you. It's a secret.,Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Monica Geller,Awww. But still no.,"No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you."
Monica Geller,"Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?","Oh no-no, I can't do that."
Monica Geller,"If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.",Okay.
Monica Geller,Okay.,"So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy."
Monica Geller,Oh my God. He threw up?,"No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.",That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Monica Geller,"Hey! Good, you're home!","Oh it's always nicer to here than, ""Aw crap! You again!"""
Monica Geller,Hey baby.,Hey.
Monica Geller,I made you a surprise.,Oh yeah?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.",Did you not understand the story?
Monica Geller,You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
Monica Geller,It's hard for some people!,Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Monica Geller,Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!,Hey!!!
Monica Geller,No!,Quick! What time is it?!
Monica Geller,I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?,Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Monica Geller,Yeah?,Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Monica Geller,What's the matter?,Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Monica Geller,"Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.","Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist."
Monica Geller,"That's not true, there are great pictures of us!","No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this..."
Monica Geller,"Oh, here's a great one.","Yeah, I'm not in that."
Monica Geller,Chandler what do you say?,"All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",I do?
Monica Geller,"Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.",Okay.
Monica Geller,"I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!",Aww!
Monica Geller,"They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.",Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Monica Geller,Hey! There you are!,There I am!
Monica Geller,Are you okay?,"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine."
Monica Geller,What?!,"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, what were you thinking?","I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down..."
Monica Geller,Chandler?,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Okay.,"Oh yeah, that looks good."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we really do!",Okay.
Monica Geller,"Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.",That's sweet.
Monica Geller,"No, it's more like a good luck.","So uh, what did this woman look like?"
Monica Geller,"She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.","Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?"
Monica Geller,"Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?","No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,"Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God yes! Who is she?,"Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend."
Monica Geller,Did you break up with her?,"No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her."
Monica Geller,Why?,"Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Monica Geller,Fat?!,"I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-ow..."""
Monica Geller,You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!,"Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?"
Monica Geller,"Well, apparently she does.","Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me."
Monica Geller,Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!,Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Monica Geller,You're Lewis Posin.,Who?
Monica Geller,"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?",Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Monica Geller,"No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.",What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Monica Geller,"No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.","Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!"
Monica Geller,It's pretty clear.,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
Monica Geller,Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.,I would really love it if could do both.
Monica Geller,"All right, I...I have to ask.",What?
Monica Geller,Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?,What?!
Monica Geller,"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Monica Geller,In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!"
Monica Geller,"Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.","Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
Monica Geller,How?,You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Monica Geller,"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!","Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica."
Monica Geller,Keep going.,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Monica Geller,Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?,I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Monica Geller,I love you.,Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
Monica Geller,"Well, she saw the ring.",Did she freak out?
Monica Geller,"Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.",Right.
Monica Geller,"Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.",You said no right?
Monica Geller,Huh?,You said no right?!
Monica Geller,"Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!",Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Monica Geller,Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.,What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!",Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Monica Geller,Really?,No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Monica Geller,So-so you would've just lied?,Yes!!
Monica Geller,Would it really have been that easy?,Yes!!!
Monica Geller,What are we gonna do?,I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Monica Geller,We'll just...we'll just let her stay.,"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
Monica Geller,Kinda like your Barca lounger.,Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Monica Geller,That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.,"Feelings, such strong feelings."
Monica Geller,"All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!","I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!"
Monica Geller,Chandler? Can you give me a hand?,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment."
Monica Geller,Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Monica Geller,That's my pie!,Which smells delicious!
Monica Geller,Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,What?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!","Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!"
Monica Geller,"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!","Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?","Well, it still has to go, right?"
Monica Geller,Why?,"Okay, it's um..."
Monica Geller,Don't do what?,"I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs."
Monica Geller,"Hi, honey.","Please, please, please, don't be mad at me."
Monica Geller,Making holiday candy for the neighbors.,"I'm sorry, who?"
Monica Geller,I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.,But we don't know the neighbors.
Monica Geller,See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.,Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Monica Geller,"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!","Well, either that or uh..."
Monica Geller,Who is that?!,"Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?"
Monica Geller,Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.,4:00 A.M.
Monica Geller,"See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!",What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Monica Geller,It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!,Y'know what would work?
Monica Geller,Hmm?,Stop making candy!
Monica Geller,But they like it!,You mean they like you.
Monica Geller,Maybe.,Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Monica Geller,Thank you.,You're welcome.
Monica Geller,Did you smoke?,No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Monica Geller,Betrothed...,...betrothed couple.
Monica Geller,No.,How long have we been home?
Monica Geller,About a half an hour.,Lovely!
Monica Geller,No.,Why not?
Monica Geller,You need to give him money.,Give him money? It was a joke!
Monica Geller,"No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.","Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
Monica Geller,You've got to be smooth about it.,"Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it."
Monica Geller,How did it go?,Had the money in the wrong hand.
Monica Geller,"It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!",How do you know so much about this?
Monica Geller,I don't know.,"Richard used to do it, didn't he?"
Monica Geller,We'd be eating our soup right now.,Mustached bastard...
Monica Geller,"Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!",Excuse me...
Monica Geller,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?",Santa? Really?
Monica Geller,"Yes, is that okay?",Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica Geller,No.,Then it's okay!
Monica Geller,"My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!","Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends."
Monica Geller,"Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.","No, I'm not!"
Monica Geller,She's sleeping.,"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?"
Monica Geller,"Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.","Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like..."
Monica Geller,It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.,What?! Ow!
Monica Geller,With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.,It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Monica Geller,"Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.","Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!"
Monica Geller,Okay that does sound like fun.,"Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
Monica Geller,The second sister dies?!,"No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading."
Monica Geller,The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?,That's correct.
Monica Geller,"Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?",What? What? What?
Monica Geller,Are you still awake?,Yeah! You?
Monica Geller,You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...,Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Monica Geller,What?! What are you doing?!,Do you know what just happened?
Monica Geller,Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.,No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Monica Geller,"Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!",Monica?
Monica Geller,What?!,"I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!"
Monica Geller,"Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!",Okay.
Monica Geller,Give me the good stuff.,"Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor."
Monica Geller,That really was some of your best work.,"Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
Monica Geller,I have to be up in seven minutes.,"Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes..."
Monica Geller,Really?!,Do you wanna?
Monica Geller,Heyyy!! You got the door open!!,Hey-hey are you drunk?
Monica Geller,"Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!","Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!"

Monica Geller,Okay. I love you so much.,Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Monica Geller,What about your breath?!,"That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised."
Monica Geller,Okay. I can do that.,Okay.
Monica Geller,Yay!,See? Here we go.
Monica Geller,Paul!,Phil.
Monica Geller,Phil!,"Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine."
Monica Geller,Awwwww...,Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Monica Geller,Oh man!,What?
Monica Geller,Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!,Don't do it.
Monica Geller,What is that?,I think it's the dying cat parade.
Monica Geller,It sounds like it's coming from across the street.,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,What?,"Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You're half Scottish right?"""
Monica Geller,Nooo!!,Yes!!
Monica Geller,"No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!",Why is your family Ross?!
Monica Geller,"He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!","If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang."
Monica Geller,Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.,Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Monica Geller,What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.,You mean the spitter?
Monica Geller,Come on! It wasn't that bad!,Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Monica Geller,"All right, what about the third guy?",You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Monica Geller,Can you blame him?,"Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, ""I do,"" he's thinking, ""Yeah, I'd do her too!"""
Monica Geller,Well then we still have a problem.,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?,Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Monica Geller,Is Joey here?,"Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?"
Monica Geller,Wouldn't you be?,"Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!"
Monica Geller,Really?,You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica Geller,"Well, not anymore.",But we don't do that.
Monica Geller,"I know, I just thought it would be fun.",How drunk are you?
Monica Geller,Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.,That's the perfect amount!
Monica Geller,Y'know what's weird?,What?
Monica Geller,This doesn't feel weird!,I know.
Monica Geller,You're a really good kisser.,"Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?"
Monica Geller,Hm-hmm!,Okay!
Monica Geller,Wow! You are really fast!,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.

Monica Geller,One!,Two!
Monica Geller,Two!,Three!
Monica Geller,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",Eh!
Monica Geller,What?!,What?
Monica Geller,No because it-it didn't seem important.,"Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!"
Monica Geller,"Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!","It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin."
Monica Geller,Chandler.,Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Monica Geller,I will.,Do you want me to call?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.",What are you guys talking about?
Monica Geller,Don't come in here!,Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Monica Geller,No! We only mess around at his place!,"Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?"
Monica Geller,"No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.",Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!

Monica Geller,"Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.",Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Monica Geller,Really?,"Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?"
Monica Geller,"Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.",Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Monica Geller,"Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.",Okay!
Monica Geller,Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?,I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Monica Geller,"See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?",Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Monica Geller,"Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?","Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big"
Monica Geller,You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?,Kinda. They're really big.
Monica Geller,Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?,What?
Monica Geller,"Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?","No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
Monica Geller,"Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?","Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating."
Monica Geller,Even with me?,"I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives."
Monica Geller,Really?,"Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink."
Monica Geller,"Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...",Water! Water! Water!
Monica Geller,Hey!,Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Monica Geller,Oh boy me too!,Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Monica Geller,Yeah?,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
Monica Geller,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",That's me! Come on!
Monica Geller,"Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.","Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
Monica Geller,Chandler!,I'll be right with you.
Monica Geller,She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.,"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.","This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins."
Monica Geller,"Oh please, you just want more blue pins.",Well this is just sad!
Monica Geller,"Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.",Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!,Batman has a utility belt!
Monica Geller,007 has a fancy car!,Batman has the Batmobile!
Monica Geller,007 gets all the ladies.,Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Monica Geller,How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.,"Actually, I don't like martinis."
Monica Geller,How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?,"Ooh, yum!"
Monica Geller,Oh.,"Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming."
Monica Geller,Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!,Do you realize you get louder each week?
Monica Geller,There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?,"I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow."
Monica Geller,"Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.","Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?"
Monica Geller,No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.,Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Monica Geller,Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.,"Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door."
Monica Geller,"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.",Okay.
Monica Geller,"Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!",There are seven?! That's one?
Monica Geller,It's kind of an important one!,"Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down."
Monica Geller,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?,You'll get one.
Monica Geller,Oh yeah? When?,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
Monica Geller,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
Monica Geller,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?","No, no, no."
Monica Geller,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,"Uh, uh."
Monica Geller,Well?,Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Monica Geller,"Wait, wait, wait!","Look, Monica..."
Monica Geller,Look!,This is not going to work.
Monica Geller,I bet this will work!,You are so great! I love you!
Monica Geller,What?,"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
Monica Geller,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!,No I didn't!
Monica Geller,"Yes, you did!",No I didn't!
Monica Geller,You love me!,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Monica Geller,Then all your stuff would be here.,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
Monica Geller,"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.",Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Monica Geller,Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!,"Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?"
Monica Geller,Chicken? I could eat some chicken.,Hey Joe!
Monica Geller,I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.,Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Monica Geller,"Actually, I did!","Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Monica Geller,"Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...","Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
Monica Geller,She's bluffing!,"Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!"
Monica Geller,You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!,"Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?"
Monica Geller,"Well actually, Ross doesn't.","Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
Monica Geller,Oh that's so sweet.,So we both finished our vows.
Monica Geller,Chandler!!,"Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.","Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation."
Monica Geller,Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.,I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Monica Geller,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!,"Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
Monica Geller,Here!,What's this?
Monica Geller,It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.,Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Monica Geller,"We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.",Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Monica Geller,"No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.",Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...","No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.",He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Monica Geller,Who's Mr. Girabaldi?,Does it matter?!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.","Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you."
Monica Geller,Yes!,So I really never get to win anymore?
Monica Geller,I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.,No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Monica Geller,Why not?!,"I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
Monica Geller,What?!,"Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go."
Monica Geller,That can't be your father.,"Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!"
Monica Geller,What?,That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Monica Geller,You okay?,Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Monica Geller,Old?,The young hot ball and chain.
Monica Geller,"Honey, we gotta go!",Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Monica Geller,"I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.","Yes, include more people in this."
Monica Geller,"Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?",Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Monica Geller,"I just, I can't believe that we made it!",Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
Monica Geller,I'm sorry but...nothing.,What?
Monica Geller,"Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.",Honestly? Me too.
Monica Geller,Really?,Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Monica Geller,"Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!",Okay. I'll be right there.
Monica Geller,"Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.",We're the Bings.
Monica Geller,Not now.,Okay.
Monica Geller,What baby?,Our baby.
Monica Geller,We have a baby?,Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Monica Geller,I didn't take a pregnancy test.,Then...who did?
Monica Geller,Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!,Who's the father?
Monica Geller,Why?!,Why not?
Monica Geller,"Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!",No?
Monica Geller,No.,I've been taking dancing lessons.
Monica Geller,What?!,"Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget."
Monica Geller,Oh that is so sweet!,So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Monica Geller,What's the matter?,"I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery."
Monica Geller,"Well, are you going to be able to do this?",Not well.
Monica Geller,"Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?",Did it turn into sand?
Monica Geller,"Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine.","No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot."
Monica Geller,"That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!","And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!"
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, right.",We got the honeymoon.
Monica Geller,That's not 'til Thursday.,The wedding pictures?
Monica Geller,They won't be ready for weeks.,Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Monica Geller,That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!,"I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home."
Monica Geller,Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!,It's picture time.
Monica Geller,Wow! That is a great picture!,Eh?
Monica Geller,That would be a good idea.,Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
Monica Geller,You kissed another woman!,Call it even?!
Monica Geller,Yeah I am!,"Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama..."
Monica Geller,"Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.",What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!
Monica Geller,I didn't think you could keep it a secret.,What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
Monica Geller,They're kissing let's just go around them.,"Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love."
Monica Geller,Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.,We are on our honeymoon.
Monica Geller,"You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!","25J and K, any chance those aren't together?"
Monica Geller,Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?,No.
Monica Geller,Me neither! We have to get in!,Just act like you belong.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Oranges!,Shh! Nice to see you again.
Monica Geller,I can't believe we're here.,Oh you've got to be kidding me.
Monica Geller,What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!,What else is new?
Monica Geller,"No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!","They're terrific, and they live right here in the city."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.","I'm sorry, we're just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with."
Monica Geller,Oh great!,Ross! It's got your wavy black lines!
Monica Geller,Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.,Let's call 'em.
Monica Geller,"Uh sorry, wrong number.",Here you go.
Monica Geller,They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?,"I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions."
Monica Geller,"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.",I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Monica Geller,Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!,Well maybe it was all of your questions.
Monica Geller,What about my questions?,"The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?",Was that another question?
Monica Geller,You used the Europe story!,That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Monica Geller,"Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5... That is their old number! Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!",Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Monica Geller,What?! I thought he'd love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!,The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Monica Geller,"Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.",No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Monica Geller,"Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey.",I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
Monica Geller,"Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!",That means nothing to me. Come on!
Monica Geller,"Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.","Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win."
Monica Geller,Is that a secret or a lie.,"No, I let him win-Ross!"
Monica Geller,Chandler please!,Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
Monica Geller,Hey.,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!","Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this."
Monica Geller,"Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?","No, it wasn't you."
Monica Geller,Well then who?,I got a maid. Yay!
Monica Geller,"I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...","Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control..."
Monica Geller,"Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!","Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges."
Monica Geller,Did she really say that?,"Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?"
Monica Geller,"Fine, I can do it. Whew.",What's the matter?
Monica Geller,Okay.,See? I told you.
Monica Geller,She stole my jeans!,What?
Monica Geller,I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Monica Geller,Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!,She must've been planning this for years!
Monica Geller,I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!,"Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?"
Monica Geller,I guess.,"So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?"
Monica Geller,Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?"
Monica Geller,"Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",How come?
Monica Geller,Because I put my head between her legs.,To see her pants?
Monica Geller,They're my pants!,Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Monica Geller,No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.,"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?"
Monica Geller,Fine. She's wearing my bra!,Oh dear God!
Monica Geller,My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!,And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
Monica Geller,Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!,Here's another plan...No!
Monica Geller,I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!,Why?
Monica Geller,Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!,I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Monica Geller,"Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!",You see that?
Monica Geller,Do you see this?,All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Monica Geller,"Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.",You need new clothes.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.",What?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!",Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...
Monica Geller,"Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.","Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore."
Monica Geller,Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
Monica Geller,"Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?","Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough."
Monica Geller,I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?,"Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?"
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper.",Monica! Wait!
Monica Geller,What?,Carry on.
Monica Geller,"Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off.",Could you not narrate?
Monica Geller,Is your team winning hon?,Yeah! Anderson just scored again! There's no Anderson.
Monica Geller,Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!,"I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, dinner's ready!",Good game!
Monica Geller,Everyone at our school heard it!,Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Monica Geller,"Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.","Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
Monica Geller,Hey! So what do you think?,New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
Monica Geller,"Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent",Oh my God!
Monica Geller,I know.,I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you.""",She had a point.
Monica Geller,They're mine!,"Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them."
Monica Geller,"Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?",I have you.
Monica Geller,Hey guys!,Hey-hey.
Monica Geller,"See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...",You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
Monica Geller,Ahhhhhhhh!,What's wrong?
Monica Geller,Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.,"Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight."
Monica Geller,"Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?","Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a...supple leather lining."
Monica Geller,I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.,Why not?
Monica Geller,"Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!",Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Monica Geller,"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.","You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!"
Monica Geller,"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.",Okay.
Monica Geller,Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!,"I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?"
Monica Geller,"Oh no, we can't walk!","What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go."
Monica Geller,Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?,What's going on?
Monica Geller,I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!,What?
Monica Geller,"Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!",So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
Monica Geller,How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?,Hop on.
Monica Geller,"Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh...","Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on."
Monica Geller,Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!,Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
Monica Geller,My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?,I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",I don't have your boots.
Monica Geller,Well I don't have them either. Where are they?,"Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!"
Monica Geller,"Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!","Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.",Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Monica Geller,Okay. All right.,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?",No.
Monica Geller,That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.,"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?"
Monica Geller,From the tequila factory?,"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
Monica Geller,Come here. I can breath through my mouth.,"Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives."
Monica Geller,"I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?","Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet."
Monica Geller,"Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.","Oh, okay."
Monica Geller,All right.,I kinda like it here.
Monica Geller,Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.,Well what did it do?
Monica Geller,"Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.",A vending machine?
Monica Geller,Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!,Who cares? It's a stupid game.
Monica Geller,You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.,I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
Monica Geller,"No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?",Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Monica Geller,Hey.,You are not going to believe what I did today!
Monica Geller,Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.,I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!","Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!"
Monica Geller,What is the matter with your hand?,"Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty words."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, why would you do that?",Because it's awesome.
Monica Geller,You think this is clever?,"Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge."
Monica Geller,"Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.",It is when you put it together with that one.
Monica Geller,"Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.","Come on, he won't even know what they mean."
Monica Geller,Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.,Have you talked to him lately?
Monica Geller,"All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.","No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!"
Monica Geller,Honey you-you got to beat your scores!,With the claw?!
Monica Geller,"All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
Monica Geller,But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.,"Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!"
Monica Geller,Don't touch her!!,All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Monica Geller,Hi.,"Are you, are you high?"
Monica Geller,I just had the most amazing bath.,Really? I don't like baths.
Monica Geller,"Wait, you like them with me.","Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady."
Monica Geller,"Oh, baths are so relaxing!",Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Monica Geller,"How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.","Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?"
Monica Geller,"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",Sex on the balcony?
Monica Geller,"No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?",What is it?
Monica Geller,I drew you a bath!,"Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?"
Monica Geller,"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!","Well, this does butch it up a bit."
Monica Geller,"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!","All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
Monica Geller,So?,Oh my God.
Monica Geller,"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!",I'm going to need a bigger boat.
Monica Geller,Hello?,"I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong."
Monica Geller,You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.,I'm in the bathtub.
Monica Geller,Oh. What's wrong?,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!"
Monica Geller,What?,The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.
Monica Geller,"Okay, let's talk about something else.","Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!"
Monica Geller,"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and...",I had the exact same conversation.
Monica Geller,You did? What was he talking about?,I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
Monica Geller,That was a long night.,"All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, he was talking about rules.",Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,"Umm, and looking at people differently.",He didn't say anything about that to me.
Monica Geller,What did he tell you?,"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules."
Monica Geller,"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.",But what did he mean by rules?
Monica Geller,Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!,Because he was looking at her differently.
Monica Geller,"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Monica Geller,Just a minute! That's Mrs. Tribbiani!,You don't say anything.
Monica Geller,"Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?",I'm not going to let you say anything.
Monica Geller,You just stay here!,"Oh, God!"
Monica Geller,Hey.,Do I smell essential oils?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.",Okay.
Monica Geller,What do you think you're doing?,L-leaving my troubles behind?
Monica Geller,"I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.","Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!",You like Rachel?!
Monica Geller,"It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?",Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
Monica Geller,I'm not touching you.,You're not?
Monica Geller,It's the salts.,"Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!"
Monica Geller,No.,"Hey Pheebs, what's up?"
Monica Geller,Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?,Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
Monica Geller,"No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?",How about to the street say from the balcony?
Monica Geller,Why don't we just find a place for it?,Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Monica Geller,No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?,How about the closet by the bathroom?
Monica Geller,"Oh, okay. Here, why don't you let me do it?","Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?"
Monica Geller,No reason. I-I keep private things in there.,"Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?"
Monica Geller,Feminine stuff.,Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go.",Fine.
Monica Geller,Thank you!,Love you.
Monica Geller,How did you get in there?!,You're messy.
Monica Geller,Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!,I married Fred Sanford!
Monica Geller,"No Chandler, you don't understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know...I'm sick.","No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that."
Monica Geller,Really? You promise you won't tell anyone?,"Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet."
Monica Geller,"Okay! I'll be right out. I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.",'Candy and Cookie'. 'Candy and Cookie?' Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
Monica Geller,I've still got it!,Why did you get me this?
Monica Geller,What is it?,"It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating..."
Monica Geller,"Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?",I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?","Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now."
Monica Geller,"Honey, what's going on?","Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?"
Monica Geller,Mm-hmm.,How long it took to go back in the water?
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day!",You don't know. You didn't see it.
Monica Geller,"Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.","Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?"
Monica Geller,"Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!","See, honey, there's-"
Monica Geller,How long has it been this time?,90 seconds.
Monica Geller,That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.,"You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",I can do that.
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank God!","Oh, I know!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, my God.",Poor Ross.
Monica Geller,"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.","Oh, And We Should Warn You, Before You Watch It don't watch it."
Monica Geller,"She's right...of course not. Honey, get the tape.","This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go."
Monica Geller,"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!",And look how happy the mom is now!
Monica Geller,Not really.,What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
Monica Geller,I'd move in tomorrow!,Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
Monica Geller,I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?,"Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals."
Monica Geller,Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.,"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough."
Monica Geller,Jeez! What is with you?,"I'm sorry, did you say cheese?"
Monica Geller,"All right, what's going on?","Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?",No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
Monica Geller,I don't believe in soul mates either.,You don't?
Monica Geller,No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.,So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Monica Geller,"No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",I love you.
Monica Geller,I know.,Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers. No? Really? They taste so good.
Monica Geller,Sure.,What?! No! No!
Monica Geller,"Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?",Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
Monica Geller,"Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?",In the James Taylor case.
Monica Geller,Where is the James Taylor CD?,"Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case."
Monica Geller,"Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.","Well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y'know alphabetically or by genre?"
Monica Geller,"Good. Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?",They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.
Monica Geller,"Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.",And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Monica Geller,"Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.",It's a dog.
Monica Geller,It's a dead dog. That's Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.,It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
Monica Geller,"Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?",Yeah.
Monica Geller,Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.,"Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could ."
Monica Geller,You think we're being obvious?,"No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this."
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, this is horrible!",I'm so sorry.
Monica Geller,"No. He Teaches A Course On Food Criticism At The New School, So Before We Go To The Movies I Wanna Go By There And Make Him Try My Bouillabaisse Again. Oh, I Cannot Wait To Read The Front Page Of The Post Tomorrow! ""Restaurant Reviewer Admits I was wrong about Monica.""","The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?"
Monica Geller,"Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.","He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class."
Monica Geller,"Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.",I haven't seen this dress.
Monica Geller,"Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?",Yeah?
Monica Geller,"Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.",Okay.
Monica Geller,What-what-what's that now?!,"Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready."
Monica Geller,Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!,"Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?"
Monica Geller,What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?,I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
Monica Geller,What?,"Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good."
Monica Geller,We are pretty good.,But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Monica Geller,"Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.",What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
Monica Geller,What?!!,I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
Monica Geller,"So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?","We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, hold on a sec.",Period math?
Monica Geller,Yeah.,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Well, we could start trying. Now.",Right here?
Monica Geller,"No, not here. Maybe here.","Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!"
Monica Geller,I think we found a place.,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?","Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go."
Monica Geller,Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!,"Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine."
Monica Geller,"We could, or we can have sex in it.","Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
Monica Geller,Does that sound like Janice?,"If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!","It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.","Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?"
Monica Geller,"I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.","And if not, we got to do it on a bucket."
Monica Geller,I want a baby.,"Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way."
Monica Geller,"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?","I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!","This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door."
Monica Geller,It wasn't fun?!,"Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want."
Monica Geller,Hey dad!,Hey.
Monica Geller,So sexy. Honey.,Yea yea.
Monica Geller,Honey why don't you go lie down.,"No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?"
Monica Geller,Hey.,Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Monica Geller,Okay what's up.,"Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?"
Monica Geller,Oh yeah .,"Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?"
Monica Geller,What? Who says that?,People who've never ever been to Paris.
Monica Geller,What's going on?,We're moving to Tulsa!
Monica Geller,Excuse me?,"Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes."
Monica Geller,"Tulsa, Oklahoma!","The Sooner State, whatever that is."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!",Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Monica Geller,"Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?","No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it."
Monica Geller,Thank you.,What is wrong with Emma?
Monica Geller,Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep.,Oh so there can't be any yelling.
Monica Geller,No.,We're moving to Tulsa.
Monica Geller,What!?,"Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you."
Monica Geller,I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.,"There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?"
Monica Geller,Hey!,I've got good news!
Monica Geller,You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?,"Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job."
Monica Geller,So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.,"I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?"
Monica Geller,No. I can't be away from you for that long.,Really?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.",That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Monica Geller,"Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.","Hey, you said that without gagging!"
Monica Geller,Excuse me?,I know what she's talking about.
Monica Geller,"Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.",He saw a therapist?
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Monica Geller,That's so sweet. Find anything?,Slim Pickings.
Monica Geller,"Nothing, huh?","No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite."
Monica Geller,'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.,'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Monica Geller,"Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.",Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Monica Geller,You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.,What?
Monica Geller,"So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.",How far outside?
Monica Geller,Manhattan.,"And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job."
Monica Geller,"I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
Monica Geller,"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",I think you should take the job.
Monica Geller,Really?,Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
Monica Geller,Promise to call me when you land.,Of course I will call you. I love you.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job, you. This is just something I have to do.",I know.
Monica Geller,I love you so much.,I know that too.
Monica Geller,: is everything all right?,"everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise."
Monica Geller,: I'm gonna go freshen up ok.,Ok honey. that was close. -Cut to Rachel.
Monica Geller,": Hi, how was your flight?",oh it was great.
Monica Geller,": Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you.","well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!"
Monica Geller,: Ok This is how much I love you.,Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Monica Geller,: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.,no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Monica Geller,": Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?",does what always have to be sharks.
Monica Geller,": Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.",What's going on?
Monica Geller,": sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.",let ME be a part of this!
Monica Geller,: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!,no they don't.
Monica Geller,: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.,"OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn."
Monica Geller,: really?,yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
Monica Geller,: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!,"You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that."
Monica Geller,Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?,"No thanks, I'm good."
Monica Geller,"O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?","Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower."
Monica Geller,You don't need a shower.,"Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences."
Monica Geller,What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?,"Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore."
Monica Geller,,"But, those are for you."
Monica Geller,"How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.","I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking."
Monica Geller,So what? Don't you have any will power?,Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
Monica Geller,You said that was sexy!,"'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again."
Monica Geller,"That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.",You forbid me?
Monica Geller,Mhmm.,"You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?"
Monica Geller,"Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.","Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
Monica Geller,Yes.,"Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now."
Monica Geller,"Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.",Fine. What!?
Monica Geller,"Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month.",You serious?
Monica Geller,Oh yeah!,"Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking."
Monica Geller,"Huh, and no cuddling.",And no kissing your neck.
Monica Geller,"Oh good, I hate it when you do that.",And lots of kissing your neck.
Monica Geller,Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.,"Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way."
Monica Geller,"Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.","That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?"
Monica Geller,"No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.",Mean it?
Monica Geller,Yah.,"You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you."
Monica Geller,D'you want to?,"Yeah, let's celebrate life!"
Monica Geller,You know what? Let's not talk.,What?
Monica Geller,Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.,But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Monica Geller,"Oh, blablablabaybaybay.",Leave it.
Monica Geller,I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.,You tricked me to get me into bed?
Monica Geller,"That's right, I got mine.",I feel so used.
Monica Geller,"Well, we had a little fight.",I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Monica Geller,"You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.",I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Monica Geller,"Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.","Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
Monica Geller,"Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.",You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Monica Geller,"So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?","So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?"
Monica Geller,I LOVE MY NEW JOB!,"Honey, you're screaming."
Monica Geller,YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.,"Oh, that's great."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.",Awesome.
Monica Geller,Heeeeeey!,Hey!
Monica Geller,Was your cabin pressurised?,And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Monica Geller,"No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?","Yeah, he came up..."
Monica Geller,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.",Were you there?
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!","If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza."
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!",What is so funny about that?
Monica Geller,"Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!",Did you tell her what we talked about?
Monica Geller,"Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.",Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Monica Geller,"Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...","I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
Monica Geller,"Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.","Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.",I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
Monica Geller,"Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!","Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!"
Monica Geller,My dad told me. They play golf together.,"Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face."
Monica Geller,So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?,Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Monica Geller,Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?,"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches."
Monica Geller,Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?,This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Monica Geller,"Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.","Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.","Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air..."
Monica Geller,Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!,"Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends."
Monica Geller,THAT'S NOT ME!,What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Monica Geller,That bastard taped over me!,Is that a problem?
Monica Geller,"Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?","Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?"
Monica Geller,"No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.","Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint."
Monica Geller,"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Monica Geller,"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..",I will explain it to her.
Monica Geller,Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.,"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.."
Monica Geller,"I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.",Why?
Monica Geller,"well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.","Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?"
Monica Geller,"Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.","Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?"
Monica Geller,Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Monica Geller,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.,"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be."
Monica Geller,No you learn these things. You grow into it.,"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it."
Monica Geller,I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?"
Monica Geller,"Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?",You said that to me last week.
Monica Geller,Like only if the queen comes?,Maybe not even then.
Monica Geller,Hello?,Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Monica Geller,"Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.","But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you."
Monica Geller,"Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me."" So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .","I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this."
Monica Geller,Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.,"Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.","Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it."
Monica Geller,I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.,All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
Monica Geller,"Yes, because all good plans start with, ""I'll go down the fire escape.""","Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here."
Monica Geller,Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.,I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Monica Geller,Scary pigeon's back?,It's huge.
Monica Geller,Chandler! You're home!,"That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop."
Monica Geller,What are you saying?,Joey said that you're in here with another man.
Monica Geller,I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.,Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Monica Geller,You can go.,What?
Monica Geller,You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.,Really? You're gonna be okay?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.","You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?"
Monica Geller,It's gonna be so hot!,"Okay, bye."
Monica Geller,"It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!","So, who does?"
Monica Geller,"It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.",Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
Monica Geller,You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??,Did I not mention that?
Monica Geller,No!,AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
Monica Geller,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?",Santa? Really?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, is that okay?",Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica Geller,No.,Then it's okaaay!
Monica Geller,So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?,"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
Monica Geller,Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.,It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Monica Geller,"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?",I sent them home.
Monica Geller,"Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?","Uhh, uh..."
Monica Geller,What does she do there?,"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
Monica Geller,She did WHAT?,BE-LOW me!
Monica Geller,*What*??,"Well, she... she didn't win..."
Monica Geller,"Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.","Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
Monica Geller,Okay.,I'm serious!
Monica Geller,Okay!,Merry Christmas.
Monica Geller,Merry Christmas.,"Merry Christmas, you guys!"
Monica Geller,Really?,You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica Geller,"Well, not anymore.",But we don't do that.
Monica Geller,"I know, I just thought it would be fun.",How drunk are you?
Monica Geller,Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.,That's the perfect amount!
Monica Geller,Y'know what's weird?,What?
Monica Geller,This doesn't feel weird!,I know.
Monica Geller,You're a really good kisser.,"Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?"
Monica Geller,Hm-hmm!,Okay!
Monica Geller,Wow! You are really fast!,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica Geller,We're gonna see each other naked.,Yep!
Monica Geller,Do you wanna do it at the same time?,Count of three?
Monica Geller,One!,Two!
Monica Geller,Two!,Three!
Monica Geller,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",Eh!
Monica Geller,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.","Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this."
Monica Geller,I think you're better than you think you are.,"Really? Okay, so..."
Monica Geller,Know when to stop.,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Monica Geller,Yeah. Don't do the dance.,Right!
Monica Geller,"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.","Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
Monica Geller,You're so efficient. I love you!,Let's go!
Monica Geller,"No-no-no, wait! We need something old!","Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
Monica Geller,That'll work!,I don't think so.
Monica Geller,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",Here just...take this.
Monica Geller,That's stealing!,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
Monica Geller,Ohh.,"Okay, one thing at a time."
Monica Geller,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",Ehh.
Monica Geller,"Eh, you work for that.","Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
Monica Geller,You do?!,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?","Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
Monica Geller,You thought about that?,Yeah.
Monica Geller,How many kids were we gonna have?,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
Monica Geller,What else did you think about?,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",Sure you do.
Monica Geller,"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.",You sure?
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.,I love you so much.
Monica Geller,"Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?",Hey!
Monica Geller,What are you doing here?,I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Monica Geller,"But I thought if you left, you get fired.",Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Monica Geller,Oh my god!,"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
Monica Geller,"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!",Thanks!
Monica Geller,"Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.",I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Monica Geller,"Well, I just lost my erection.","I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
Monica Geller,You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.,But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Monica Geller,"Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!",Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.",How long was I in there?
Monica Geller,Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.,Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Monica Geller,Don't you want to look through the rest?,"I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
Monica Geller,"You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!","I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"""
Monica Geller,"I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.""",Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Monica Geller,I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.,"""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
Monica Geller,"Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.","Yeah, Ross is here so..."
Monica Geller,Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.,"Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant."
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?,That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Monica Geller,You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!,Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Monica Geller,"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?","That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
Monica Geller,Like a month?,Or a year?
Monica Geller,"Really, you want to wait a year?","It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer."" It'll probably be more than a year."
Monica Geller,I really wanna have a baby.,"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back."
Monica Geller,"No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",I quit and you learn what I do?
Monica Geller,"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.",I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Monica Geller,"It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!",Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Monica Geller,"Yes, please!","Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time."
Monica Geller,Would you stop staring at her?,I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Monica Geller,"Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!",Really? In front of all this people?
Monica Geller,And they love me!,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"""Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection...""",Are those my wife's nipples?
Monica Geller,"Oh, who cares, they still love me! ""I am so excited...""","You, touching yourself, out!"
Monica Geller,Oh my god.,Wow.
Monica Geller,"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",I don't do that.
Monica Geller,Yeah.,Today is the sixth.
Monica Geller,"No, it's not.","Yes, it's also 2003."
Monica Geller,Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Monica Geller,Okay.,Tough crib.
Monica Geller,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Monica Geller,Chandler!,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Monica Geller,We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not."
Monica Geller,"So, let's do this.",I - I don't think I can.
Monica Geller,"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",Because of Emma.
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",Sorry.
Monica Geller,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?","Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it."
Monica Geller,Canoodling?,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y."
Monica Geller,"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...",Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Monica Geller,I guess you're right.,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,Emma was doing it!
Monica Geller,She's asleep.,"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
Monica Geller,"Yes, but we have to be fast.","Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise."
Monica Geller,"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",I think we may have really done it this time.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",You may wanna get some more of those too.
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?","Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",Okay.
Monica Geller,So far so good!,"Honey, I'm old!"
Monica Geller,What's wrong?,I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Monica Geller,So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these."
Monica Geller,What are they?,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Monica Geller,"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.","Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?","No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for."
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,"Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything."
Monica Geller,I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?,"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron."
Monica Geller,"I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.",Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Monica Geller,"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.",You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Monica Geller,Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,No! We're not borrowing money.
Monica Geller,Why not?,Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Monica Geller,Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Monica Geller,"Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look like""",Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Monica Geller,We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!,Yes dear.
Monica Geller,Thank you?,Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Monica Geller,"Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?","No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form."
Monica Geller,"Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.","Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
Monica Geller,Okay...,"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that."
Monica Geller,Honey?,Yeah?
Monica Geller,About that? Erm...I'm going to change.,But honey you don't have to.
Monica Geller,I'm going to get bigger!,Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Monica Geller,"Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.",your ass?!?!?
Monica Geller,It's kind of a package deal!,God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Monica Geller,I thought I was something that we both wanted!,"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
Monica Geller,We're all sorry...,"Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you."
Monica Geller,"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... ""gay as the day is long""?",Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Monica Geller,But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.,Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Monica Geller,"Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.","Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go ."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,"Oh, you'll see my friend."
Monica Geller,"Hi, glad you could come.","Please, come in."
Monica Geller,I look like a man??,"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
Monica Geller,You are married though.,"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.","Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!"
Monica Geller,God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.,Pie eating contest?
Monica Geller,Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?,"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
Monica Geller,Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!,Yeah I know.
Monica Geller,"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",He's the boss's son.
Monica Geller,Yeah.,What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Monica Geller,There are no tickets on the nightstand!,"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago."
Monica Geller,"Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!","Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
Monica Geller,Ahhh!,"Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, play them!","Ok, here we go!"
Monica Geller,"Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.","Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?"
Monica Geller,Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.,"Ah, the ""I'm sorry I rejected you"" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve."
Monica Geller,"Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!",Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Monica Geller,You know what? You can have mine.,Me too.
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!",Are you really that busy?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.","Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. ""Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"""
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Monica Geller,Is he gonna introduce us?,"No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.",Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Monica Geller,You really liked it?,"Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", I was uplifted."
Monica Geller,Oh really!,"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
Monica Geller,No!,Did somebody sign your bra?
Monica Geller,Hey honey! I missed you today!,"Oh, yeah?"
Monica Geller,Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?,"Oh, well... Maybe we could..."
Monica Geller,"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.",We really need to take those tests?
Monica Geller,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.",But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Monica Geller,What is the big deal?,It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Monica Geller,It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?,"I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
Monica Geller,"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!","Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"
Monica Geller,OH!,"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?","Yeah, I guess!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!",Why are you here?
Monica Geller,This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!,"I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date..."
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie.,Doctor Connelly just called.
Monica Geller,"With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said ""Doctor Connelly just called"". If it was good news you would have said ""Doctor Connelly just called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?",Actually it's both of us.
Monica Geller,What?,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
Monica Geller,Oh... what does that mean?,It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
Monica Geller,Chandler?,"It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us."
Monica Geller,Oh my God!,I'm sorry.
Monica Geller,I'm sorry too.,"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!","Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
Monica Geller,Hi honey!,"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I guess.","So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
Monica Geller,Excuse me?,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!","No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
Monica Geller,Chandler!,"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
Monica Geller,I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,Ok!
Monica Geller,Uh!,Zack!
Monica Geller,"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!",You don't like him.
Monica Geller,I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.,Alright! Just follow my lead!
Monica Geller,Yess!!,We're teeth people Zack!
Monica Geller,Does seem pretty perfect.,"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?"
Monica Geller,No.,"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
Monica Geller,"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.","Yeah, he's better!"
Monica Geller,"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",Really? Are you sure?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm sure.","Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
Monica Geller,That is so sweet. I love you.,So you know this leaves us with...
Monica Geller,Adoption.,How do you feel about that?
Monica Geller,I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.,Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Monica Geller,"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?",Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!",We are gonna be great parents.
Monica Geller,"And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.","Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
Monica Geller,See?,"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
Monica Geller,Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.,"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do"" ""I do""."
Monica Geller,"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Monica Geller,What? Why?,"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?","I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?"
Monica Geller,"They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.","Man, that's some bad advice!"
Monica Geller,"Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!",That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Monica Geller,Ok!,David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Monica Geller,See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?,That would be advice!!
Monica Geller,"Well, I hope you're happy!","Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!","Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!"
Monica Geller,"No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!",And there's not chance that will work?
Monica Geller,"No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.",Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Monica Geller,"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!",This vacation sucks!!
Monica Geller,I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.,"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.","I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!"
Monica Geller,The sun is out!,Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Monica Geller,"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.",Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Monica Geller,"Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!",I don't think so!
Monica Geller,Why not?,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
Monica Geller,I'm not always that bad!,"Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?"
Monica Geller,I punched you...?,And...?
Monica Geller,"So, we're just four losers... SUPER!",I'm not playing with you.
Monica Geller,"Hell, yeah!",Did you know this about him?
Monica Geller,One thousand...,OK!
Monica Geller,No... Either of you girls got a quarter?,"Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
Monica Geller,AH YEAAAAH!,Do you really find this attractive on him?
Monica Geller,"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!","Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
Monica Geller,I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!,But...
Monica Geller,"Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!",What about the obsessive cleaning?
Monica Geller,Aww!,You ok?
Monica Geller,I can't believe it! I lost!,"No, you didn't."
Monica Geller,What?,Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Monica Geller,"Honey, you don't have to do this.","Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."
Monica Geller,But... you suck!,"You're welcome, sweetheart."
Monica Geller,Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?,"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
Monica Geller,Why?,I don't know.
Monica Geller,This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!,That's why!
Monica Geller,"Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?","You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired."
Monica Geller,I'll put a pillowcase over my head.,You're on!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, that's Charlie!",She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Monica Geller,I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?,How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
Monica Geller,I'm on it!,Anything?
Monica Geller,"Bedsprings, unmistakable!",You do realise that's your brother?
Monica Geller,"Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.",That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.",Okay Buckwheat!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!",Bye!
Monica Geller,What do you think?,I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Monica Geller,And listen to this...,What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!","You go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
Monica Geller,Yeah!,"So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
Monica Geller,"Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?",What are you singing?
Monica Geller,"It's ""Bolero"" from ""10"".","It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See, Here's The Thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!"
Monica Geller,You what? You said you liked them.,Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
Monica Geller,"Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.","Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
Monica Geller,"You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!",Hit yourself in the tooth?
Monica Geller,I have a problem.,Really? What happened?
Monica Geller,"Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman, No Cry"" and I got stuck.",You can't move at all?
Monica Geller,"Oh, well, I can move...","If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?"
Monica Geller,I guess so...,Some of these look a little frayed.
Monica Geller,Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...,"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?"
Monica Geller,"Sure, what do you have in mind?",I think you know.
Monica Geller,Really? I don't really feel like it.,This is what I want to do.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.","She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant."
Monica Geller,"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.",There's a hair in my coffee.
Monica Geller,Can I adopt you?,"Hey, you must be Owen."
Monica Geller,They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?,We have to leave!!
Monica Geller,Why? What did you do in the bathroom?,"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him."
Monica Geller,"Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.","Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him."
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Monica Geller,"I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!",Who's Amanda?
Monica Geller,"She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. ""Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!""",Are you trying to do a British accent?
Monica Geller,Chandler gets pedicures!,"Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?","No, had it done to me though. Feels good !"
Monica Geller,"We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!",I get pedicures!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!",You don't know!
Monica Geller,We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.,"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
Monica Geller,Hey guys!,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.",There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Monica Geller,"All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.","Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party..."
Monica Geller,Hey!,Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Monica Geller,I can't believe Emma is still asleep!,"I know, what are we gonna do?"
Monica Geller,I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!,I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Monica Geller,"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!","We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday."
Monica Geller,Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?,I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Monica Geller,"No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...",They left.
Monica Geller,"Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.","I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?"
Monica Geller,Game?,"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little."
Monica Geller,That's how old you are.,Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Monica Geller,"Ooh, I want one...",Me too...
Monica Geller,...and head to Canada!,I was kidding.
Monica Geller,You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!,That's where people make number two!!
Monica Geller,"Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!","You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump."
Monica Geller,"I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...","Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!","It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter."
Monica Geller,Okay good.,"Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. ."
Monica Geller,"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.",They loved it.
Monica Geller,What?,They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
Monica Geller,They thought Joey was a child?,"She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings."
Monica Geller,Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.,Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Monica Geller,We?,You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Monica Geller,"Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?",What...? NO!
Monica Geller,Chandler?,"I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!"
Monica Geller,"Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?","I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!","Ok, ok, here we go."
Monica Geller,Ok.,Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
Monica Geller,Yay!,But you already gave all your money to charity!
Monica Geller,"Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!","That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady."
Monica Geller,Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.,"Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law."
Monica Geller,Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.,"But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building."
Monica Geller,"Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.",Wrong number?
Monica Geller,It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.,That's great!
Monica Geller,Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...,Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Monica Geller,We need to talk to you about something.,Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Monica Geller,"That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!",Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Monica Geller,"Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!",We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Monica Geller,Did someone drop the baton again?,Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Monica Geller,I don't get older. I just get better!,"You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!"
Monica Geller,You don't know that.,Somebody is gonna pick us.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!","I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!"
Monica Geller,Name one of his books.,"""The Firm""?"
Monica Geller,"Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...","You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year."
Monica Geller,"Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.","I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile""."
Monica Geller,"Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.",Tell me more.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!",You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Monica Geller,Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!,I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
Monica Geller,Do you hear something?,They're out there!
Monica Geller,"Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!","Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game!"
Monica Geller,Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!,Ross' shirt is torn.
Monica Geller,No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.,"Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?"
Monica Geller,Nothing. It's fine.,Oh thank God!
Monica Geller,"Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.","Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it."
Monica Geller,Stinky?!,Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Monica Geller,"Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.","Uhm, we've got turkey grease."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, where are your tools?","Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!"
Monica Geller,I don't care.,What's going on?
Monica Geller,That was the adoption agency...,And?
Monica Geller,WE'RE GETTING A BABY!,Are you serious?
Monica Geller,Hey!,"We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio."
Monica Geller,And a lot could still get in our way.,"Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.."
Monica Geller,Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!,So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Monica Geller,"You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!","Yes, but..."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!","Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!"
Monica Geller,"Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?","Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: ""Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"""
Monica Geller,"Uh, we're gonna be great.",You're gonna be great.
Monica Geller,Amen.,Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?","Yeah, I did."
Monica Geller,Why not?,It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Monica Geller,God works in mysterious ways.,You have gotta stop!
Monica Geller,But she liked us.,She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Monica Geller,"Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.","Your Veal Chop is $34,95!"
Monica Geller,"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.",But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Monica Geller,Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.,I know..
Monica Geller,"I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?","oh, honey.."
Monica Geller,"Please.. please, we are so close.","Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to."
Monica Geller,"okay, right.","So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
Monica Geller,Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?,You're Jewish.
Monica Geller,Sex!,"Seriously, answer faster!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!",It's like a giant hug.
Monica Geller,Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.,I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Monica Geller,Nancy doesn't smoke!,"Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!"
Monica Geller,So? What do you think of the house?,It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
Monica Geller,Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?,And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
Monica Geller,Don't you love the huge yard?,And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Monica Geller,"And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!",This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Monica Geller,So? Do you think we should get it?,I don't know. What do you think?
Monica Geller,I think we should.,I do too.
Monica Geller,This is huge!,I know.
Monica Geller,"How bad you wanna smoke, right now.","I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day."
Monica Geller,Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?,"We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
Monica Geller,Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.,I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?",Hey!
Monica Geller,"Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.",Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Monica Geller,"And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...",...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Monica Geller,"And about an hour ago, we made an offer.","Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE."
Monica Geller,"And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! TIME LAPSE.",Hey.
Monica Geller,She really left.,I know.
Monica Geller,Thank you.,No problem roomie.
Monica Geller,Can I ask you a question?,Sure!
Monica Geller,What the hell is that dog doing here?!,"Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
Monica Geller,And?,"Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price."
Monica Geller,We can't afford that.,I know.
Monica Geller,"I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.","Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then."
Monica Geller,What?,We got the house.
Monica Geller,Oh my God!,I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?,We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
Monica Geller,And a baby...,We're growing up.
Monica Geller,We sure are.,So who's gonna tell them?
Monica Geller,Not it!,Not it! Damn it!
Monica Geller,"Or ""Win, Lose or Draw"".",What did I marry into?
Monica Geller,Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.,You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Monica Geller,Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.,O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
Monica Geller,That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.,Soo... you girls having fun?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! That's wild!,"Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter."
Monica Geller,"Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.","Seriously, where did this happen?"
Monica Geller,You were my first kiss ever?,What did I marry into?
Monica Geller,"Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.",I'll do it.
Monica Geller,Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.,Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Monica Geller,I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.,Oh yeah!
Monica Geller,"Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.",Ready?
Monica Geller,Hey.,Why are you wearing my apron?
Monica Geller,"I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.","Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""? No? Divorce?"
Monica Geller,"Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...","Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!"
Monica Geller,Honey.,I'm so sorry...
Monica Geller,"Everyone. Erica, baby!","Monica. Calm, self."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.",New York is awesome!
Monica Geller,What is with you?,"Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know."
Monica Geller,Are you awake?,Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Monica Geller,"Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.","Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer."
Monica Geller,"Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?",I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
Monica Geller,How?,"I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.","Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!"
Monica Geller,"Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.","Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?"
Monica Geller,No it's not.,How do you know?
Monica Geller,The thing we never do.,Shovely Joe!
Monica Geller,"Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.","You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it."
Monica Geller,Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...,YOU NEVER DID IT!
Monica Geller,I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.,"Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me."
Monica Geller,"All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.","Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city."
Monica Geller,Thank you for letting us see the house again.,"And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.","Man, those two dogs are going at it!"
Monica Geller,"So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.",Excuse me?
Monica Geller,Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.,"For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents."
Monica Geller,How is that gonna happen?,Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Monica Geller,"Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.","We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright."
Monica Geller,But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?,What do you think Pheebs?
Monica Geller,Joey's gonna be *so* upset.,I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Monica Geller,What if he reads it in the paper?,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay."
Monica Geller,Thanks.,"It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?"
Monica Geller,"No, actually, we're buying the house next door.",Why!?
Monica Geller,"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.","The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers."
Monica Geller,"Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.","That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, you come up with an idea.","Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out."
Monica Geller,But we love our house.,"Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and ""Oh My God""!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.","Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!,Where's your passport?
Monica Geller,"Are, are you kidding? This is packing?",We're taking a break!
Monica Geller,From?,Jumping on the bed?
Monica Geller,Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.,"Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!"
Monica Geller,What are you talking about? These aren't mine.,"Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!"
Monica Geller,"That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.",Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Monica Geller,Rachel used to live in that room.,Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Monica Geller,Joey's bare ass!,. Well played.
Monica Geller,You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.,That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Monica Geller,Yeah. Mine too.,Mine was a humdinger.
Monica Geller,We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.,Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Monica Geller,Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.,You couldn't be cool.
Monica Geller,"Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.","Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are."
Monica Geller,You did? How?,"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used."
Monica Geller,Oh my God!,Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Monica Geller,"She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.",Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!","Honey, it's gonna be okay."
Monica Geller,Oh my God!,Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Monica Geller,She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.","Next time, can I say breathe?"
Monica Geller,"Alright, I'll be right back.",Where are you going?
Monica Geller,To use the bathroom.,You can't leave me alone with her.
Monica Geller,What?,This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Monica Geller,What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?,"It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together."
Monica Geller,"You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.",Okay.
Monica Geller,"Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!",I'm okay.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!","Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle."
Monica Geller,It's a... It's a boy!,Wow!
Monica Geller,"Oh, you did it!",It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Monica Geller,"Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!",I know. He has your eyes.
Monica Geller,"What do you mean ""what do we do""?",Twins! Twins!!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you're panicking!","Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?"
Monica Geller,We can't split them up!,"Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody."
Monica Geller,"Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?",What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.","Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!"
Monica Geller,"That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of ""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!",Okay. Shhh...
Monica Geller,Okay!,Okay!
Monica Geller,Do you think they recognize each other from in there?,"Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet."
Monica Geller,"Oh, look at these little bunnies!",I know! You ready to trade?
Monica Geller,Okay.,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Alright, let's see..",We could trade later.
Monica Geller,"This is a boy, and that's a girl.",Her name is Erica.
Monica Geller,I love you.,I love you.
Monica Geller,"Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.",Alright.
Monica Geller,Alright. My job here is done.,That was... Impressive.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.","Sorry about the table, man."
Monica Geller,"Well, that's it. Everything's packed.","Wow, this is weird."
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.","Oh, okay."
Monica Geller,This is harder than I thought it would be.,"Oh, it's gonna be okay."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,And I just want a million dollars!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Not so much!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Thanks.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Here we go.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,What?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,That's it?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,How do you do that?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,I'm free! I'm free!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,There you go!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,You're definitely scaring here.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Oh, no-"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Shall I carve?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Oh, will you give me the thing."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,...And then he burst into flames.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,What are you guys doing out here?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,What was that?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Hey.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Hey Phoebe!

TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Now, is that never talking about it again?!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Still broken?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,You win.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Hey.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it."

TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Whoa, snowing out there?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Thank you!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,See now it feels like Christmas!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"What, what are you laughing at?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"...so then the farmer says, ""That's not a cow and you're not milking it."""
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Okay, one more time."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Did you hear that?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Hey.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Yes?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Oh my God, introduce us!"

TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Whoa, she's pretty."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and..."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,What happened?!!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Janice?!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Ross.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?"
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"It's okay, I got a plan."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Oh my God.

TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Do you know what I was thinkin'?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Okay, we owe you a present."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,Guys?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"All right, I'm off to see your dad."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it."
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,No-no-no-no. Hey!

TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,...Come on! Why are we here?!
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,The hot chicks?
TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?"

TRANSCRIPT_NOTE,,"Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?"

#ALL#,Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?"
#ALL#,Okayyy!,"All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference..."
#ALL#,"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..","Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream."
#ALL#,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.","Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas."
#ALL#,Ohhh! Put it out!,"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out."
#ALL#,No no no!,"I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!"
#ALL#,Yeah!,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue..."
#ALL#,Saw your head. Saw your head.,"She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you."
#ALL#,Ooooohhh.,"Oh, so you're divorced?"
#ALL#,What?!,"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?"
#ALL#,Yeah! Right!,WHAT IS IT?!
#ALL#,Yes. Absolutely. A quality.,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
#ALL#,"Yeah, okay. Alright.","Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm."
#ALL#,Awww!,This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
#ALL#,What is it?,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
#ALL#,That's great!,So.... I quit.
#ALL#,Why?,Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
#ALL#,Oh!... Right!,Hey Rach!
#ALL#,Hi. Hi.,What are you doing here?
#ALL#,"Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.",Joey was in a porno movie.
#ALL#,Huuh.,"If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me."
#ALL#,C'mon. Let her. Yeah.,"Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home."
#ALL#,Woah.,"So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid."
#ALL#,"Did not, she did not wink at you....",Huh.
#ALL#,All right!!,"Oh, good job Joe."
#ALL#,Yay!!,"See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig."
#ALL#,Yeah.,"Okay, good."
#ALL#,Oh.,"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them."
#ALL#,Woooo hoooo!!!,"Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'"
#ALL#,Yeah! Punch him!!,"Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?"

#ALL#,Hey!,"Hey man, how did the audition go?"
#ALL#,What?!,"Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!"
#ALL#,Why?!,"I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
#ALL#,Mmm.,"Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert."
#ALL#,Ohh!,I'm so sorry you're sick.
#ALL#,Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!,"What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?"
#ALL#,We want candy! We want candy now!,"All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?"
#ALL#,Oh!!,That's great!
Phoebe Buffay,No.,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me."
Phoebe Buffay,"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.","Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants."
Phoebe Buffay,Doy! Probably right before she lost it!,You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.",What does she do?
Phoebe Buffay,- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!",And this- is my reward!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!","Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
Phoebe Buffay,If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!,"Yeah, alright."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.","Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."
Phoebe Buffay,This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.,It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, have a good break-up.","Hey, Janice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it was really hard.","Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god. How many of those have you had?,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.",I'm fine.
Phoebe Buffay,It's like a gift.,We should always always break up together.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.","Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.,"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
Phoebe Buffay,"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...","Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute.",Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.","I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!","Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
Phoebe Buffay,"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.",Might wanna open with the snowman.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you wish!","It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!",That guy's going home with a note!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...","Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?","Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
Phoebe Buffay,Your mom was arrested?,"Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.","And, we're done with the yogurt."
Phoebe Buffay,So was it a lot more money?,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....",Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?","Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
Phoebe Buffay,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?","Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the ""a-gogo."""
Phoebe Buffay,That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.",Look at this!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! You have a window!,Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Phoebe Buffay,Oh look! That guy's peeing!,"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
Phoebe Buffay,OK.,"This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, really.","Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Rifts. Yeah, I know.","Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years."
Phoebe Buffay,"I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...",Youre not gonna lose him.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?",There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Phoebe Buffay,"But... I'm ready, so, just deal.","OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.","That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie."
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?","Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler?,Couldn't be more out.
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?",Rachel lost Marcel.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!","Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?","Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
Phoebe Buffay,That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!,"And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Phoebe Buffay,How many beeps?,She answered.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",What?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!,"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
Phoebe Buffay,Doing it on this table.,Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,"Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.",Pirates again?
Phoebe Buffay,"What... I could, I could do it. What is it?","Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story."
Phoebe Buffay,I could be a secretary.,"Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Phoebe Buffay,"Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.",I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Phoebe Buffay,"Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.",What?
Phoebe Buffay,Ross says hi.,Ah!
Phoebe Buffay,"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?","Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
Phoebe Buffay,"Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.",Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,All right. Bye bye.,Bye bye.
Phoebe Buffay,Whatcha doin'?,Ooh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.","See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.",Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.",What?!
Phoebe Buffay,I thought you knew that.,Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Phoebe Buffay,Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.,What are you talking about?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah. They even do you.",They do me?
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.",Work people? Nobody told me.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.","You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.",You think I should?
Phoebe Buffay,"I really do, yeah.",Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,You were great. But they still made fun of you.,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!""","Then, I don't get it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.",They do?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.,I just wan't to...
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but you can't.",But I just wa...

Phoebe Buffay,"I know. This is really, really huge.",No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe Buffay,Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.","Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered."
Phoebe Buffay,"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.",What did you just do?
Phoebe Buffay,You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.,Maureen Rosilla.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!","Ok, Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.","Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed."
Phoebe Buffay,I'd call that excessive.,Whoa!
Phoebe Buffay,Janice? You called Janice?,"Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?"
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh. Why is that?,"If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!"
Phoebe Buffay,You have a third nipple?,You bitch.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?","Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake."

Phoebe Buffay,"No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.","Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,"So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.",Why did you look at me when you said that?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.,"Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er."
Phoebe Buffay,You're all invited to bite me!,Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.","Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow. What are you gonna use it for?,Games and stuff.
Phoebe Buffay,What were you thinking?,"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason."
Phoebe Buffay,I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.,"Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?"
Phoebe Buffay,"This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.","Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame."

Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.","Well, so why not go knock?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,"Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges."
Phoebe Buffay,You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.,"Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.","Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooohh, why?",Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,Guess who's back in show business.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?","No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no.","OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.","Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia."
Phoebe Buffay,That's him.,Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Phoebe Buffay,I miss Rose.,"Oh, yeah?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, that's so nice.","I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,Stick a fork what?,"Like, when you're cooking a steak."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.","Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.","OK, then, eat me, I'm done."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?",How long you been waitin' to say that?
Phoebe Buffay,Because she's your lobster.,"Oh, she's goin' somewhere."
Phoebe Buffay,"C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .","Hey, you feelin' better?"
Phoebe Buffay,What is that sparkly thing?,"That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy."
Phoebe Buffay,Do you want a refill?,"No, I'm alright, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.","I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's."
Phoebe Buffay,It's not that bad.,"Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection."
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, Chandler.","I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good."
Phoebe Buffay,Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.,"Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.","What am I gonna do, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.,Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Phoebe Buffay,We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.,"Hey, woah, hey, woah."
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.",She's one of us now.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.","Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.","Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago."
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler.,You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Phoebe Buffay,"No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.","Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time."
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you play with your roommate?,"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?","No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room."
Phoebe Buffay,"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",We don't need to remedy that.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.",That was so lame.
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.","So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?"
Phoebe Buffay,Why would you kill his fish?,"Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish."
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.",We came over as soon as we saw.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.",Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.","Hey, big guy, game time."

Phoebe Buffay,What does she mean by HH?,It means we're holding hands.
Phoebe Buffay,Are you the cutest?,I'm afraid I might just be.
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.","Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'","All right. ""My husband is sleeping with his secretary."" She's married!"
Phoebe Buffay,Well at least we know she's a woman.,I can't believe she's married.
Phoebe Buffay,"Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?",What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, my.",What?
Phoebe Buffay,She wants to meet you in person.,"Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband."
Phoebe Buffay,"What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.","Okay, I'll do it!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...",Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.","All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up."
Phoebe Buffay,Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!,Sorry Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.",Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm ready.","Oh, aaaah!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'",What are you supporting?
Phoebe Buffay,Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.,Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.","Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."
Phoebe Buffay,"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?","Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,"Hey, man. What's up?"
Phoebe Buffay,"'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",Is anybody else scared?
Phoebe Buffay,"'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.",Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!

Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, nobody good?","Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's Monica's bed. What?,Okay. It's a racecar.
Phoebe Buffay,"So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?","Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, it's just my tooth.",All right I'll have one.
Phoebe Buffay,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.",See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Phoebe Buffay,"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.","That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse."
Phoebe Buffay,Love....,"I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind."
Phoebe Buffay,I know.,I've found.
Phoebe Buffay,I've found....,"...in you, my endless love. My endless love."
Phoebe Buffay,Isn't there a national football league.,"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
Phoebe Buffay,This is the worst Christmas ever.,"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house."
Phoebe Buffay,"You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!",It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, what happened?","Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part."
Phoebe Buffay,We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!,"Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat."
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks you guys! Thank you.,Don't worry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!",It must take you forever to find your keys.
Phoebe Buffay,"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!","Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!","What, what, what?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!",You really think that is what he meant?
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.","Oh, hey."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.",You mean a three pointer?
Phoebe Buffay,You guys!! Come on!,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped."
Phoebe Buffay,"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'","We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",I like her.
Phoebe Buffay,Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?,"Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people."
Phoebe Buffay,"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.","Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, come here.","Oh, that's mature."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.","Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...."
Phoebe Buffay,Should we do something?,"Yeah, never cheat on Rachel."
Phoebe Buffay,We could eat the wax! It's organic.,"Oh great, food with hair on it."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, not the used wax.",Because that would be crazy?
Phoebe Buffay,"They're gonna get through this, aren't they?","Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.","Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."
Phoebe Buffay,Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?,"Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place."
Phoebe Buffay,"Him? Him, Ross?","Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism."
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler!!,What?
Phoebe Buffay,What does the sign say?,Beam me up Jesus.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.","Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.","Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!",Hey!!
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?","Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!,I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.",Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Phoebe Buffay,"So, you're like a zillionaire?",And you're our age. You're our age.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...",'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Phoebe Buffay,It isn't?,"No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay well, he would turn things to gold.",What about things that are already gold?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ahh, his work is done.","Okay, let's play my game now."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,Hello.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",And is this in case the house sneezes?
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, oh, about three months.","Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in."
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?",Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!",Ye-e-es!!
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.,Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
Phoebe Buffay,No.,Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I...","Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.","And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.","Well sensitive is important, pick him."
Phoebe Buffay,All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.,"Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeesh, what'd you do about it?","Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?",Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.","Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965."

Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?",That's a good call. Right.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.","Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! New wallet, huh?","Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.",Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?","All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!","I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!"

Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!""",It doesn't say that. Does it?
Phoebe Buffay,"What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.","You mean like, music?"
Phoebe Buffay,Does Joey know?,"No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?"
Phoebe Buffay,I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!,Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Phoebe Buffay,"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!","Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials..."
Phoebe Buffay,"You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.",Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, get out of my kitchen!","All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'll get it.",Gotcha!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, that paper's two weeks old.","All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?","Hello, children!"
Phoebe Buffay,You work with robots!!,"Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer."
Phoebe Buffay,"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...","Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?"

Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",Prague?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.",You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.","Oh, I can uh, check that for ya."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.","Yeah, but I bet it works."
Phoebe Buffay,That's a good idea for a business!,"I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, ""So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?"" And she'll go, ""No-no-no, it's Chandler."" And he'll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"No, sorry.","All right, maybe I should call her."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh good!,She is now.
Phoebe Buffay,How? How is your fault?,"Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!"
Phoebe Buffay,Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!,"You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you think it will help.","No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice"
Phoebe Buffay,You should! How is she?,Ohhh!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.",Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,And do you know what girls are really good at?,Stripping!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! What is that? What is that?,Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I wanna be with her, I like her.","Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
Phoebe Buffay,What?! I thought you were crazy about her!,"Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!"
Phoebe Buffay,Janice.,"Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack."
Phoebe Buffay,God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!,Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.",Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.",Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.",Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.",They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.

Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",What's the second part of your plan?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?",A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,"Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!",All right.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.","Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?","Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?","Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, Gene.",It's Clint. It's Clint!
Phoebe Buffay,"Bye, Gene.",It's Clint! Clint!
Phoebe Buffay,Drum roll.,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
Phoebe Buffay,You're actually going through with this?,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson."
Phoebe Buffay,"You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.",Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!",Okay. Thanks.

Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, it's not bad.",Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. You won't be able to take it.,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
Phoebe Buffay,They're gonna call her Chandler.,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.",Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.

Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!","Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?"
Phoebe Buffay,Really?,"Oh, do you not want to?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.",Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.","It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex."
Phoebe Buffay,You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.,Not if I kiss you first.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh.,"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
Phoebe Buffay,And why not?!,Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe Buffay,I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.,"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh good!,"Yeah, I wanna go to babe."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?,Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, cups.","Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.",Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Phoebe Buffay,"Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!","Great job with the cups, Pheebs!"
Phoebe Buffay,And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!,Awesome!
Phoebe Buffay,This is so cool!,"So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!"
Phoebe Buffay,"My God, Joey!",It was a car backfire!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm fine, thanks.","Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?"
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe this!,"Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!","So, what are you gonna do?"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!,Me?! Why me?
Phoebe Buffay,"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!","I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?","Yes I did, and I think you should do it."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!,"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady."
Phoebe Buffay,You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!,"I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him."
Phoebe Buffay,He shot a bird!,Oh that is over!
Phoebe Buffay,I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!,"Wow umm, calm down."
Phoebe Buffay,You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?,"Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.","Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs."
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!,"Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?"
Phoebe Buffay,That game should not be played without my supervision.,"Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge."
Phoebe Buffay,What's in the bag?,"Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.,Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.","Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!",Really?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?",Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,On a totally different bet.,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.,Huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm gonna go too!","Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?",So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, what about after I give you these candies?","Yeah, I guess it's a little better now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.",Happy plane-aversary.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.",What-what Richard thing?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no.,What Richard thing?
Phoebe Buffay,"For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!",Oh my God.
Phoebe Buffay,Noo! But that would've been so cool!,No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?",No!
Phoebe Buffay,But she just came up here!,That was Joey!
Phoebe Buffay,I wonder where she is. That is so weird.,"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
Phoebe Buffay,Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.",Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!,Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.",What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Good! Good! I was just testing you.,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you know that psychic I see?",Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.",What?!
Phoebe Buffay,I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,What's going on?,"Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!"
Phoebe Buffay,We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.,"Oh, all right."
Phoebe Buffay,Another lie. You have a sickness!,"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!",Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Phoebe Buffay,"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.","Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone."
Phoebe Buffay,"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.","They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"
Phoebe Buffay,What?!,"Glass, sand, whatever."
Phoebe Buffay,How did that happen?!!,"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat."
Phoebe Buffay,"But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",I think that's gum.
Phoebe Buffay,I'm pretty sure it's gun.,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!",Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,How do you feel?,"Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.",And protected them from a tornado?
Phoebe Buffay,So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, how much do you think he needs?","I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride."
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,Well that would help the pride thing.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?,"Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing."
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, we do it every year!","Oh well, that makes it not terrible."
Phoebe Buffay,But we have to!,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well then, you should look with us.",Why?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!","Those are my gifts, I got them for you."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Look who I found!,"Oh, hey guys!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.","Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
Phoebe Buffay,"Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!","Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, don't look directly at them!",What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.",Oh great!
Phoebe Buffay,Hee hee!,"Wait, we can't do this."
Phoebe Buffay,Why?,"I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about."
Phoebe Buffay,Will you get us better gifts?,Fine!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.,"Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, what's going on there?","Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin."
Phoebe Buffay,So that story doesn't make you cry?,"No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.",But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Phoebe Buffay,"My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.","Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!"
Phoebe Buffay,What are you two girls whispering about over there?!,But I think we should tell her.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!","Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!,"Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?",I made a...
Phoebe Buffay,What is that?,Nothing!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!",How's your room Rach?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.",Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah she said something about crumbies.,No! No! No! I was so careful!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.",Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.",Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Phoebe Buffay,"My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these",A face ass?
Phoebe Buffay,Have you seen your guy's body?,"No, our guy is just a floating head."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, like there are police for that!",Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Phoebe Buffay,My guy is well read.,Our guy has great hair.
Phoebe Buffay,My guy has great teeth!,Our guy smells incredible.
Phoebe Buffay,"No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.",Are you funny?
Phoebe Buffay,It's not that bad.,"Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection."
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, Chandler.","I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!"
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",This is going in your book?
Phoebe Buffay,I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.,Who?
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!,Oh my good God.
Phoebe Buffay,I know what time you said.,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.",What does it say?!
Phoebe Buffay,I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.,"Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything."
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks! So are you.,I told you I should not wear this color.
Phoebe Buffay,"Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.",So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, you guys.",Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!,I'll give up my ticket.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay that's so generous!,And I think Ross is generous too.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, did she buy it?",Totally.
Phoebe Buffay,So did Heldi show you the place?,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, have you told anyone else?","No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out."
Phoebe Buffay,You told me.,"Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.",Me too.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?",Oh all right.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.","Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this."
Phoebe Buffay,Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?,"Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, I found the perfect ring.","Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!",What?
Phoebe Buffay,Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!,They put you in jail?
Phoebe Buffay,The little jail between the doors!,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe it was the guy.,It was the ring!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Phoebe Buffay,It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!,"No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.,I can't do that.
Phoebe Buffay,There he is!,Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.","Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him."
Phoebe Buffay,Here he is.,"Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...","Okay, that's enough honey!"
Phoebe Buffay,"If she says no, can I have the ring?",She's not gonna say no.
Phoebe Buffay,It's gone.,Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Oop!,"Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know."
Phoebe Buffay,What happened?,Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
Phoebe Buffay,Good one! Yeah.,This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.","That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!,"I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.","Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
Phoebe Buffay,"""We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l...""","Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh thank you.,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,So what do you guys want for an engagement present?,"That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us..."
Phoebe Buffay,You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?,Dying people say the craziest things.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.",An old cookie?
Phoebe Buffay,"See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.",We can't accept this.
Phoebe Buffay,Why not?,'Cause it's gross.
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, it's not that big a deal!",Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.,And say nothing?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh Willie's still alive!,What are you guys doing?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.,"I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, let's see it!",Ahhh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.","Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.",What is it doing here?
Phoebe Buffay,"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Where's Chandler?,Here I am.
Phoebe Buffay,Wash your hands!!!,How did you...know?
Phoebe Buffay,"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.",Where's Monica?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, is Chandler here?","No, no he went for a walk."
Phoebe Buffay,"Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.","Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain."
Phoebe Buffay,It's a Thanksgiving miracle!,It is so good to see you!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh and Chandler's about to cry.,Am not!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hi!,Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Haaaa... ... ahhhh!,Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay,Huh?,Skull?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, you guys!",Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.",Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, why not?","Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him."
Phoebe Buffay,"Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?","No reason, except...she...told...me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?","No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!","Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,"Oh, what's at 8:00?"
Phoebe Buffay,"There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?",That's a plane!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, what's going on?",Monica's a little drunk.
Phoebe Buffay,Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?,Pheebs!!
Phoebe Buffay,What?! No! It was my idea!,Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!,"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!,Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Phoebe Buffay,Since when are you into swing music?,Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Phoebe Buffay,What is your job?,Staying out of the way.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.,"Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too."
Phoebe Buffay,Bye Chandler! I miss you already.,"Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.","It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex."
Phoebe Buffay,You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.,Not if I kiss you first.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh.,"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
Phoebe Buffay,And why not?!,Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.","Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
Phoebe Buffay,Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!,Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Phoebe Buffay,What the hell are you doing?!,Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Phoebe Buffay,Why not?!,"Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!"
Phoebe Buffay,"But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.","I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge."
Phoebe Buffay,What? You'll hi-ya?,Monica's pregnant.
Phoebe Buffay,Cigarettes?!!,"Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary."
Phoebe Buffay,Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.,"But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.",As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
Phoebe Buffay,How about just the bridemaids?,Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!,I'd better go pack.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.","Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance..."
Phoebe Buffay,Regina Philange.,"I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's me. Phoebe!","Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume..."
Phoebe Buffay,That is so you!,When have I ever done that?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!,Her what?!!
Phoebe Buffay,Your secret bachelorette party...,You had a bachelorette party?!
Phoebe Buffay,She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!,"I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?",I have no idea.
Phoebe Buffay,What?,Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't believe you! That is...brilliant! And Monica has no idea?,Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh okay.,Oh come on!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Phoebe Buffay,Green Bay.,Detroit.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! I got you a present!!,Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Phoebe Buffay,"I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!",Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang...
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!,I did. But it came at a price.
Phoebe Buffay,I know!,One more score to go! You can do it!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.",You told her?!
Phoebe Buffay,You told me you hate massages!,"Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!,"Well, Phoebe I thought I'd--Yeah, what the hell."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!","Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, ""If it helps!"""
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey you guys!,Oh hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, and you?","No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, good.",Why?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well last night, I met Monica's.",What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.","Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.",You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
Phoebe Buffay,Soul mate.,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...,"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm so sorry.,What do we do?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.",I didn't know you read tea leaves.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.","Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.","Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?"
Phoebe Buffay,Is that a real place? Are they hiring?,Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Chandler, why so fancy?","Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, I think I know someone who does that.","Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.",Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, the interview...",What about it?
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you don't know.,Are you serious?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah."" I was like, shhh!",What is it that I do?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.",Did you like me when we first met?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.","Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?",An hour.
Phoebe Buffay,I can't help you.,Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange.""",Chandler Bing.
Phoebe Buffay,"Bing, what an unusual name.","Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.","What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me."
Phoebe Buffay,I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.,Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
Phoebe Buffay,You gotta go!,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, don't worry. You're ready.",Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Burrrrr!,You really want to take me?
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh.,"So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay? That's just what she wants.",Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh I'm kinda part of this.,Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing.
Phoebe Buffay,Bye Chandler.,Awww. Bye!
Phoebe Buffay,"'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?","Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people."
Phoebe Buffay,You smoked!,"No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos."
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.","Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a Greek goddess.,Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay,I'm gonna go.,"Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,"So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,"What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?",Nope...
Phoebe Buffay,"Broke them all, huh?",Yep...
Phoebe Buffay,You gonna tell her?,"Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.,"Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, we do it every year!","Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, we have to!","No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well then, you should look with us.",Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Ble-blah-blar Blargh!,"Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.",Ahh...
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.,"Here, pass these, will ya.."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, I think I've left something here.","Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.","Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.,I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.",I gotta stop this.
Phoebe Buffay,What's your news?,Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
Phoebe Buffay,"Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!","Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship."
Phoebe Buffay,That's great.,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating."
Phoebe Buffay,Someday.,Aaaaand....... hernia.
Phoebe Buffay,"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!","Oh, I'm so sorry!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...",You're not gonna need my help?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.","Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth."
Phoebe Buffay,Get a room!,"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
Phoebe Buffay,Don't come any closer!,"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished..."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, what's more important, your friends or money?",Friends!
Phoebe Buffay,"As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.","Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!","Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!,"What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!","So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?"
Phoebe Buffay,And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!,"""Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"" ""Oh, thank you very much!"" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont..."
Phoebe Buffay,": It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! Classy, uh?","Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.","Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!",She does?
Phoebe Buffay,"Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!",She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?",I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Phoebe Buffay,It's like watching porn!,And that's... how... it's done!
Phoebe Buffay,Sounds like he's with someone.,"He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps."
Phoebe Buffay,That's the door. He's gone...,And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
Phoebe Buffay,Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!,Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.","You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
Phoebe Buffay,"Still, he had to find out sometime.","Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, don't hold thy breath!",Hello? Is someone on the line?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!,What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!! Let's do that!,That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Phoebe Buffay,Ok! I want the dolphin!,Thats a bear.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?","No, not yet."
Phoebe Buffay,YEAH!,So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Phoebe Buffay,Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.,I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don't think he's ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!",She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?",Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Phoebe Buffay,"Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.","Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!","Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers."
Phoebe Buffay,So what did you two do about it?,"It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'll just ask for it back!",I don't think you can do that!
Phoebe Buffay,What are you gonna name the baby?,I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.",Hello.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.","Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember"".",Those are all really old!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?",I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?","Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,"You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?",No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Phoebe Buffay,I decided to pee.,Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!",Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait, oh no. Wait.",Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
Phoebe Buffay,I don't care... I'll be my something blue.,You look beautiful.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.","Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.",Mrs Hannigan?
Phoebe Buffay,"Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.",That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.","Hey, how'd the interview go?"
Phoebe Buffay,You okay with this?,"Well, it makes me feel sad, but..."
Phoebe Buffay,Talking to Ross.,I see.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?",Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,She died.,You're kidding!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.",Oh yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!,I think these are yours.
Phoebe Buffay,Tell me about it.,"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.",Where's Ross?
Ross Geller,"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...",Cookie?
Ross Geller,"No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?",Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Ross Geller,"Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.","Yes, and we're very excited about it."
Ross Geller,You guys.,"Oh, God."
Ross Geller,That only took me an hour.,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!"
Ross Geller,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.,Stay out of my freezer!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.","The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.","Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?"
Ross Geller,What is this?!,"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
Ross Geller,"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.","Okay, so this time I won't quit!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.",I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Ross Geller,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
Ross Geller,There y'go.,"Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
Ross Geller,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.",...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?","Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
Ross Geller,"So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?","Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty."""
Ross Geller,What are you doing?,I have no idea.
Ross Geller,"Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?",You got it.
Ross Geller,Peach pit.,"Yes, Bunny?"
Ross Geller,"Actually, nectarines, but basically...",Could've been a peach.
Ross Geller,"Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.",What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Ross Geller,"Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!","See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."
Ross Geller,Pass it! Pass it!,He's open!
Ross Geller,I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
Ross Geller,"Look, it's just a little more complicated...","Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
Ross Geller,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...",Then what?
Ross Geller,"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?","Oh, right, right, shut up."
Ross Geller,"Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.","Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
Ross Geller,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
Ross Geller,Nuh-uh.,Yuh-huh.
Ross Geller,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?","Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?"
Ross Geller,No.,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.",There you go.
Ross Geller,Is it? Feels like two.,"No, ten o'clock."
Ross Geller,What?,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!"
Ross Geller,Oh. Hel-lo!,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
Ross Geller,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.,"Thank you, buddy."
Ross Geller,C'mon! C'mon!,Here goes.
Ross Geller,"No? What happened, big guy?","""Big guy?"""
Ross Geller,"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.",You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Ross Geller,...Chandler!,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?",Who are those people?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I hate this story.","We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
Ross Geller,"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!","I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
Ross Geller,"I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...","Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
Ross Geller,"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.","Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...","That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
Ross Geller,Really.,"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
Ross Geller,"What, uh... what juggling thing?",With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Ross Geller,No.,"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon..."
Ross Geller,Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!"
Ross Geller,"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.",You can say that because she's not your mom.
Ross Geller,You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.,I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.",What?
Ross Geller,"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-",You knew about this?
Ross Geller,"Thanks, man, big help.",I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Ross Geller,"I wasn't- I mean, I-","Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
Ross Geller,I know-,I can't believe you did this.
Ross Geller,Chandler-,You gotta let me slam the door!
Ross Geller,"Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...","Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?"
Ross Geller,"Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.","Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare."
Ross Geller,"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?","Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
Ross Geller,We're rehearsing a Greek play.,That's very funny. We done now?
Ross Geller,"No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?","That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
Ross Geller,You mean that?,"Yeah, why not. So I told her."
Ross Geller,Yeah? How'd it go?,Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Ross Geller,"Well, howdya feel?",Pretty good! I told her.
Ross Geller,"You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?","Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
Ross Geller,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.,I know!
Ross Geller,"Come on, two on one.","What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
Ross Geller,You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?,It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Ross Geller,"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.","Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
Ross Geller,"I dunno, there's just something about...",Basically we just feel that he's...
Ross Geller,She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.,Any contact?
Ross Geller,Hey.,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third..."
Ross Geller,I think it's insane.,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
Ross Geller,Hi. She said yes.,"Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?"
Ross Geller,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?",Who are you going out with?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.",And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Ross Geller,"Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.","Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym."
Ross Geller,How did he do this?,"So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?"
Ross Geller,"Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?","You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
Ross Geller,I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.,That's nice.
Ross Geller,"Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.",What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Ross Geller,"Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.","Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.,"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
Ross Geller,Do you have a point?,"You know, you think I would."
Ross Geller,It's just a fur ball.,Okay... ..whose turn is it?
Ross Geller,"Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.","No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
Ross Geller,Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.,We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Ross Geller,"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.","So, you feel like a dad yet?"
Ross Geller,"No, why?","Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad."
Ross Geller,I don't know.,Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Ross Geller,"No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...",...little playthings with yarn?
Ross Geller,What?,Could you want her more?
Ross Geller,Who?,"Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening."
Ross Geller,"Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'",And then he did.
Ross Geller,...Yeah.,"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less."
Ross Geller,"Alright boys, let's eat.","Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
Ross Geller,You still on that?,"Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : ""When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"""
Ross Geller,Let me see! Show them!,"Y'know, I've had dates like this."
Ross Geller,I'm in for fifty cents.,Call.
Ross Geller,Fifteen.,"Alright, here's ten."
Ross Geller,Thank you.,Good luck.
Ross Geller,"Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.","They're still just friends, right?"
Ross Geller,"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...",I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Ross Geller,"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.","Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
Ross Geller,What was with the dishes?,"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
Ross Geller,"...desperate, needy, pathetic?","Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
Ross Geller,"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop"".","Ring dammit, ring!"
Ross Geller,Second date!,...I dunno.
Ross Geller,"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.","Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
Ross Geller,"What? It's, it's just a phase.","Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
Ross Geller,Hi.,Hey.
Ross Geller,At the vet.,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
Ross Geller,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",So what does this mean?
Ross Geller,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.","Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.",...Take off their hats!
Ross Geller,"Why, why, why would you dream that?","More importantly, was I any good?"
Ross Geller,I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious."
Ross Geller,"No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.","A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
Ross Geller,College?,Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Ross Geller,"Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.","Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
Ross Geller,Save it.,"Okay, hating this."

Ross Geller,"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?","Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.","Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised."
Ross Geller,Thank you.,"Hey, Rach, can I get..."
Ross Geller,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?",God?
Ross Geller,"It was you, pal.","Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
Ross Geller,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.","Well, you owe me one, big guy."
Ross Geller,Hello? Hi.,Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?

Ross Geller,Carol?,Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?

Ross Geller,"You remember Janice, right?","Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody."
Ross Geller,You comin'?,"Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down."
Ross Geller,"Whip it out, whip it out.","C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless."
Ross Geller,"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?","Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia."
Ross Geller,"Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?","Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . ."
Ross Geller,"Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.","Uh, Julie."
Ross Geller,"Man, I sure miss Julie.","Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there."
Ross Geller,You ever figure out what that thing's for?,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned."
Ross Geller,I know.,I'm back.
Ross Geller,"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob.""","I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
Ross Geller,Oh my god. You are pure evil.,"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this."
Ross Geller,"Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?","You know, I think I might just."
Ross Geller,I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.,"Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods."
Ross Geller,"That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.","We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy."
Ross Geller,Go over there and tell that woman the truth.,All right.
Ross Geller,Go.,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?","Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number."
Ross Geller,I hear ya.,We can talk about that.
Ross Geller,That's a good point.,"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?"
Ross Geller,G-gift? The thing's not the gift?,"No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish."
Ross Geller,"But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?","By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall."
Ross Geller,Come on.,"Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!"
Ross Geller,"I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.","If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel."
Ross Geller,Chandler!,Yeah?
Ross Geller,Geez! Are you ready?,Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Ross Geller,Whoa! You had sex today?,"Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming."
Ross Geller,Wow.,"Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign."
Ross Geller,Still doing the screening thing?,I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Ross Geller,Bumpy?,"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.","So, let's go."
Ross Geller,"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.","Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
Ross Geller,"Excellent, that was excellent.",I can't believe the guys missed this.
Ross Geller,Ross.,Chandler.
Ross Geller,"Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.","Yeah, we really missed you guys."
Ross Geller,Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.,"You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody."
Ross Geller,What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.,We'll watch him.

Ross Geller,Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.,"Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!"
Ross Geller,"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.","Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight."
Ross Geller,Can't we just use a pen?,"No, Amish boy."
Ross Geller,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Ross Geller,"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.","So, Spock actually hugs his father?"
Ross Geller,"He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?","Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing."
Ross Geller,Hey guys.,Hey.
Ross Geller,Hey guys.,Hey.
Ross Geller,You got me a cola drink?,"And, a lemon lime."
Ross Geller,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.",And last but not least.
Ross Geller,Alright.,"Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross."
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.","You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare."
Ross Geller,She's dating. She's dating.,"Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?"
Ross Geller,"See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.","Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?"
Ross Geller,Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.,"And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues."
Ross Geller,If you wanna call that a reason.,"Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor."
Ross Geller,Excellent!,For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Ross Geller,"No no, that's me.","Oh, yeah."
Ross Geller,Oh my god.,That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.","Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?"
Ross Geller,Ok.,All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Ross Geller,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.","Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem."
Ross Geller,"Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.","You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion."
Ross Geller,"Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.",That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Ross Geller,"This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.","What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?"
Ross Geller,What? Let me see.,"No, no, you don't have to see."
Ross Geller,Hi Tushie.,"Alright, one of you give me your underpants."
Ross Geller,"Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?","Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight."
Ross Geller,"Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.","Ya know, the man's got a point."

Ross Geller,"Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.","Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs."

Ross Geller,"Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.",What just happened?
Ross Geller,"Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...","Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?"

Ross Geller,"Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.",Don't play with his things.
Ross Geller,Thank you.,Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Ross Geller,How come it's not mixing with the water?,"Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle."
Ross Geller,No.,No?
Ross Geller,"No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.","Alright, hang on a second there Custer."
Ross Geller,"No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.","Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back."

Ross Geller,Over my dead body!,And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Ross Geller,What's she look like?,"Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet."

Ross Geller,Okay.,"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
Ross Geller,Hmph.,"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
Ross Geller,"With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!","I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!"
Ross Geller,"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?",You said...
Ross Geller,Hey!,"Hey, mister tux!"
Ross Geller,"Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.",Okay.
Ross Geller,"You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..","All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!"
Ross Geller,"I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.","You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.","All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.","All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed.

Ross Geller,"It was, it was her voice.","Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place."

Ross Geller,Hey.,Do I look fat?
Ross Geller,And it works both ways.,"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?","That's easy, baggage claim."
Ross Geller,"Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.","Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something."
Ross Geller,"Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.","Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
Ross Geller,"Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...",Yeah.
Ross Geller,I'm gonna use the cushion.,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.","Okay, the old hug and roll."
Ross Geller,Yep.,"Okay, one question."
Ross Geller,Shoot.,You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Ross Geller,"Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?",Sure. What's up?
Ross Geller,Are you intrigued?,You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Ross Geller,"And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?",Noo.
Ross Geller,"You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.","No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'"
Ross Geller,Where there is no fear of commitment.,Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Ross Geller,"Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....",What a geek!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.","All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....","Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
Ross Geller,Susan Sarandon.,"Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
Ross Geller,And!! Isabella Rosselini.,"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around."
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hi! Bye!
Ross Geller,"Heavy thing, not getting lighter!","Okay, one...two..."
Ross Geller,Hey.,"I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever."
Ross Geller,So how many more do you have tomorrow?,"Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'"
Ross Geller,"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...","Umm, how's it going with you guys?"
Ross Geller,"Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.",And was the curse lifted?
Ross Geller,"All right, we're gonna play.","But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street."
Ross Geller,Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!,"Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, losers talk!","No, no, no, actually losers rhyme."

Ross Geller,"Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.","No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?",What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Ross Geller,"Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.",We're not gonna lose to girls.
Ross Geller,"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.","Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
Ross Geller,Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.,I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Ross Geller,I know. I feel horrible. Okay.,Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Ross Geller,"All right, see you guys.","Look out kids, he's coming!"
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?","Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
Ross Geller,"....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?",I spelled out boobies.
Ross Geller,Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!,"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
Ross Geller,"Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?",Me! On my computer.
Ross Geller,Well you sure used a large font.,"Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room."
Ross Geller,"Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",Hey! How'd the interview go?
Ross Geller,"Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.","Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me."
Ross Geller,Yeah.,"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
Ross Geller,Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?,"Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba."
Ross Geller,"All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Ross Geller,It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!,"All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?"
Ross Geller,Why?,"I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist."
Ross Geller,"Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.",Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Ross Geller,"What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?",Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Ross Geller,"She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?",Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Ross Geller,Why?! How?! How is he a genius?,"Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you."
Ross Geller,What am I going to do?,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
Ross Geller,I don't know you guys.,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
Ross Geller,I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.,"Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?"
Ross Geller,What are you doing?,Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Ross Geller,Oh.,"So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?"

Ross Geller,"No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary",Wellll?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!",What do we do? What do we do?
Ross Geller,"Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.",Like an eclipse.
Ross Geller,"Hey, don't we have to...","Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
Ross Geller,Is everything okay?,"Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting."
Ross Geller,"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.","Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
Ross Geller,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?","Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
Ross Geller,"You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.","Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but don't you think....","All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.","Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!"
Ross Geller,"Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.",Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Ross Geller,"Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.","Well, then, I might as well offer to stay."
Ross Geller,Excuse me?,It's horrible.
Ross Geller,"Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.","Guys, guys, guess who I am?!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?","Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately."
Ross Geller,Hello.,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.","It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive."
Ross Geller,Then be supportive like a guy.,"If I broke up with you, I'd miss you."
Ross Geller,"I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!",You didn't just break up.
Ross Geller,"Hey, it's been like three weeks!",You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Ross Geller,"Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.",Okay.
Ross Geller,"She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!",And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Ross Geller,"Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!",Stop what?!
Ross Geller,"Look, they must be stopped!","I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!"
Ross Geller,I need juice! People need juice!!,Look man!
Ross Geller,People need juice!,Listen to me!!
Ross Geller,"Juice, I need...","She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, okay.",Okay.
Ross Geller,It's just I miss her so much.,I know.
Ross Geller,I-I know. Well if something comes up...,"Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."

Ross Geller,That's a duck.,"That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?"
Ross Geller,"Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.","Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!"
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!","Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd."
Ross Geller,One.,7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Ross Geller,"No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.","Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!"
Ross Geller,Hey.,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.",Was it like a sneeze only better?
Ross Geller,"Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.",Whoa!!!
Ross Geller,"Come on you guys, it's no big deal!",Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
Ross Geller,"Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?","No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a..."
Ross Geller,"He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.","Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
Ross Geller,"Dude, what are you doing?","Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal."
Ross Geller,"Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?","Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
Ross Geller,"That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.","Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......"
Ross Geller,Okey-dokey!,There is not one hair on that head.
Ross Geller,"She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!","Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?",NO!!!
Ross Geller,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!,Coffee house?
Ross Geller,"Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?","Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land."

Ross Geller,With such a sad history.,Could there be more Kims?
Ross Geller,So why don't you quit?,"You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria."
Ross Geller,Who is Maria?,"Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat."
Ross Geller,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?,No!
Ross Geller,So you're strong enough to face her on your own?,"Oh no, you'll have to come."
Ross Geller,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.",Yes. Yes!
Ross Geller,"One more time, ""Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?""",No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!

Ross Geller,How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?,"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great."
Ross Geller,"Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.","It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, guys.","All right! Bring it on, you..."
Ross Geller,"Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...",Oh my God! Play!
Ross Geller,"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.","Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?"
Ross Geller,"So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.","Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you."
Ross Geller,"Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?","I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.","Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets."
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.",Like?

Ross Geller,"Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.","Dude, don't do that too me!"
Ross Geller,I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.,"I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry."
Ross Geller,Dude!,Sorry!
Ross Geller,"Well, they're not mine!","Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!"
Ross Geller,Someone at work ate my sandwich!,"Well, what did the police say?"
Ross Geller,My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!,"Ross, it's just a sandwich!"
Ross Geller,"Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, ""Keep your mitts off my grub?""","Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?"
Ross Geller,On account of my rage.,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
Ross Geller,My God Monica!!,Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Ross Geller,"And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.","Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
Ross Geller,"How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!",I paid for those tickets!
Ross Geller,"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!",Oh yeah!
Ross Geller,Yay!,"Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!"
Ross Geller,"I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?",Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Ross Geller,Hey man.,What is up?
Ross Geller,"About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.","No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted."
Ross Geller,"Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.",Could I be more sorry.
Ross Geller,"I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.",I'm sorry too.
Ross Geller,"I am sorry, Chandler.","I am sorry, Ross."
Ross Geller,"Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.","Do you want us to leave the room, or?"
Ross Geller,"In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.","I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!"" And it starts right now!"
Ross Geller,Okay! Hey!,Hey!
Ross Geller,I just asked that girl out.,Nice!
Ross Geller,Yes it is. See.,Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Ross Geller,"That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.",Horn-swoggle.
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!",Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Ross Geller,"Dude, we got to talk.",Okay.
Ross Geller,"I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?",Why would I be mad?
Ross Geller,"Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.","I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you."
Ross Geller,Okay.,I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Ross Geller,All right.,"And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!"
Ross Geller,Sorry.,And the bunny got away.
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, how's it going?",Hey.
Ross Geller,No.,That new mountain bike?
Ross Geller,Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.,Your work makes me sad.
Ross Geller,"Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!","Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!"
Ross Geller,"I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!","Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
Ross Geller,"Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...",Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Ross Geller,"...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.",Sounds like a fun party.
Ross Geller,"This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break thing?"" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?",That's not funny.
Ross Geller,Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!,"Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so..."
Ross Geller,No! That's-that's my arm!,"Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch."
Ross Geller,"All right, ready?",Yeah.
Ross Geller,Turn.,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!",Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Ross Geller,"Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.",You think?!
Ross Geller,Hi!,Hi there!
Ross Geller,Yeah.,Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Ross Geller,Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?,"Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George."
Ross Geller,Wow! How'd you get in there?,"Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert."
Ross Geller,What the hell was that?!,What?
Ross Geller,"The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!",I was not flirting.
Ross Geller,"It was totally flirting. ""Somebody got a haircut ""","Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, right.",You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Ross Geller,Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!,"I was not and oh God, shh!"
Ross Geller,Well...,Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Ross Geller,"You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!",What?
Ross Geller,Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!,Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
Ross Geller,Really?!,Really?!
Ross Geller,"Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.","Okay, hold on. Okay."
Ross Geller,Gas? Wow! Intense.,"If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem."
Ross Geller,A lot of other gas smells...,Oh the humanity.
Ross Geller,Was I talking to her about gas?,More so than anything else.
Ross Geller,"That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.",It is starting to get dark out there.
Ross Geller,"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!",How do you figure that?
Ross Geller,"Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!","Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."
Ross Geller,Uh-huh. Thank Joey!,"Uh, HELLO!!"
Ross Geller,Wow! I could've died tonight.,"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life."
Ross Geller,I do have a newfound respect for life.,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
Ross Geller,Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Ross Geller,"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",It's throwing and catching!
Ross Geller,All right.,Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Ross Geller,"Oh God, here we go!",What?
Ross Geller,Hey!,Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Ross Geller,"Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.",Art lover!
Ross Geller,What'd you say?,I said art lover.
Ross Geller,Is that supposed to be an insult?,"I don't know, I'm very tired."
Ross Geller,What?,Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
Ross Geller,"Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!","Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!"
Ross Geller,"Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?","Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
Ross Geller,"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?","Yeah, I do."
Ross Geller,"Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!","Yeah, I'm not so worried."
Ross Geller,Hey everyone!,Oh hi!
Ross Geller,"Ohh! Okay! Okay. ""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into...""",Why don't you open with a joke?
Ross Geller,"Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!","Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!"
Ross Geller,I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.,That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Ross Geller,"Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.","Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Ross Geller,And now you want that money back.,Exactly.
Ross Geller,"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?",It's not a real game! I made it up!
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.",At a fake game!!
Ross Geller,"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.",Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Ross Geller,No.,"Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time."
Ross Geller,"So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.",And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Ross Geller,Thank you for bringing her into our lives.,Unbelievable
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.","All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?"
Ross Geller,"Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?",What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Ross Geller,Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?,Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Ross Geller,Put it back exactly where you found it?,Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Ross Geller,"'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.",She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Ross Geller,"Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?","She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
Ross Geller,"Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.","I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."
Ross Geller,"Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.","No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh."
Ross Geller,"Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.","What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.","OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.","Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!"
Ross Geller,"Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.","Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh""","Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that."
Ross Geller,"Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.",That's not specific to girls.
Ross Geller,"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.",And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Ross Geller,They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.,"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica."
Ross Geller,What?!,I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Ross Geller,"Dude, what'd you have?","Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place."
Ross Geller,The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.,That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Ross Geller,Bye!,"No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it."
Ross Geller,Hey guys.,Hey.
Ross Geller,What's up?,You know...Oh My God.
Ross Geller,I whitened them.,Really.
Ross Geller,"I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?","No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?"
Ross Geller,"Yes, of course they like you!",Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, they don't like you.",Do you know why?
Ross Geller,"I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-",Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
Ross Geller,"Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.",You do? Why?
Ross Geller,"Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.",What?! Why did you do that?
Ross Geller,"I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.",How could it not matter?!
Ross Geller,"How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?","What about all that ""friends forever"" stuff?"
Ross Geller,What?,I made that joke up.
Ross Geller,"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.","Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard."
Ross Geller,"Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?","Yeah, I guess."
Ross Geller,"No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.",It's my joke.
Ross Geller,"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.","So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
Ross Geller,"Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.","So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
Ross Geller,"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.","Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
Ross Geller,"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .",Okay .
Ross Geller,It's my joke.,It's my joke.
Ross Geller,"Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.",Let's have Monica decide.
Ross Geller,Yeah!,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Hey Mon.,"Mon, get out here!"
Ross Geller,Monica!,"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.","Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go."
Ross Geller,"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!",I'm not arguing with that.
Ross Geller,It's your joke.,Is not.
Ross Geller,Hey!,"Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?"
Ross Geller,"I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.",Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Ross Geller,"And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.",Hey.
Ross Geller,"She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?","No, the doctors say it may kill her."
Ross Geller,"Hey, remember when I had a monkey?",Yeah.
Ross Geller,Y'know what...,"Hey-hey, is Monica here?"
Ross Geller,No.,"Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day."
Ross Geller,So what are you gonna do?,"Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?"
Ross Geller,Chandler. I sensed it was you.,What?!
Ross Geller,Unagi. I'm always aware.,"Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?"
Ross Geller,What's up?,I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Ross Geller,"Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.",I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.","Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon."
Ross Geller,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.","Wait a minute, I can't give this to her."
Ross Geller,Why not?,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."
Ross Geller,"Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, ""I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!""","Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?"
Ross Geller,"It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.","Oh, is that against the rules?"
Ross Geller,"No, but it is frowned upon.",I see.
Ross Geller,Going out with who?,"Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
Ross Geller,Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...,"No, that was Dana Caplin."
Ross Geller,Oh that is quite all right ma'am.,"So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?"
Ross Geller,"Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.","Oh, tell her good luck with that."
Ross Geller,"You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?",Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Ross Geller,"I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?",Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.","Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?"
Ross Geller,I went to Egypt with my dad.,"I can see it now, ""Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"""
Ross Geller,I'm gonna call her.,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?","Well, maybe you don't marry this one."
Ross Geller,It's your turn.,"Oh, are we playing this?!"
Ross Geller,Totally!,So it did go well.
Ross Geller,Great!,Oh that's great!
Ross Geller,"Oh, I love that guy!","Oh-oh, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,What?,Cupping.
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Ross Geller,I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.,"Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!"
Ross Geller,"Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.","Yes, we were just..."
Ross Geller,"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.","Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place."
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?","Yeah, check out the ring."
Ross Geller,So you two are really serious?!,"Yep, pretty much."
Ross Geller,You told her before you told us?,"Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you didn't get one.","Okay, well tonight's the big night."
Ross Geller,"Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.","Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah you have the ring?","Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, you guys!!","Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!"
Ross Geller,Who?,Richard!
Ross Geller,What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.,Oh you knew that. Good!
Ross Geller,"I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.","Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, what's going on?",Hey.
Ross Geller,What's up?,Monica and I are engaged.
Ross Geller,Oh my God. Congratulations.,Thanks.
Ross Geller,"Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.",Why to save your dignity my man.
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.",Thanks.
Ross Geller,"Well, you-you've always had glasses.",No I didn't!
Ross Geller,"Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?","Uh why, do you have a lecture?"
Ross Geller,"No, why?",Then free as a bird. What's up?
Ross Geller,"Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.","Well, did-did you correct him?"
Ross Geller,You're not a lefty?,Does anybody know me?!
Ross Geller,"Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?",Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Ross Geller,"Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...",I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Ross Geller,And what did he ask you not to call him?,"Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened."
Ross Geller,'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.,Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Ross Geller,It wasn't the best.,That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hey! What's up?
Ross Geller,"Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.",Huh.
Ross Geller,"Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?",No! Shhh!
Ross Geller,You told her!,Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Ross Geller,How could you tell her?!,I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Ross Geller,Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.,Du-ude!
Ross Geller,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...","Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
Ross Geller,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...","Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
Ross Geller,All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!,Ross came in forth and cried!
Ross Geller,"Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!",That was you!
Ross Geller,"And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!",You have no trouble telling time now right?
Ross Geller,Man!,"Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office."
Ross Geller,"Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...",How about those three pointers?
Ross Geller,Amazing!,And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Ross Geller,"Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.","Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom."
Ross Geller,"Hey, divorced men are not bad men!",They have that on the napkins at the club.
Ross Geller,Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.,Dude that is so sad.
Ross Geller,I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.,Could I play?
Ross Geller,"Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?","Yeah, I just got uh, got plans."
Ross Geller,"Well, John McLane had plans!","No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!",Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Ross Geller,"Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?",Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Ross Geller,Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!,"No, no, no. No-no-no."
Ross Geller,"What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?","No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes."
Ross Geller,What? That's like insanely easy!,"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen ."
Ross Geller,Done! With time a-to-spare.,Oooh that may be a New World's record
Ross Geller,"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?","Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states."
Ross Geller,"No, just give me another minute.","Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself."
Ross Geller,"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.","Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!"
Ross Geller,It's too cold.,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable."
Ross Geller,It hurts my teeth.,"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!"
Ross Geller,"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.",Why not?
Ross Geller,Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.,"Well, I, I should go in there."
Ross Geller,"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.",Why not?
Ross Geller,Because you sent away the dog!,This is ridiculous.
Ross Geller,"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.",It's up to you.
Ross Geller,Delaware! Delaware!,All right.
Ross Geller,I want my turkey now!,You got it. You got Nevada twice.
Ross Geller,I know.,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.",Okay. Okay.
Ross Geller,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...,"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
Ross Geller,"What are you doing here, Santa?","Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
Ross Geller,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",What?
Ross Geller,What are you doing?,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
Ross Geller,"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.",Why?
Ross Geller,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.",But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.","Fine, I'll give the suit back."
Ross Geller,"Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.","Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
Ross Geller,Yeah?,My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Ross Geller,"Y'know, she tried to undress me too.",I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" That's weird isn't it?","Couldn't I just say, ""This is Ross?"""
Ross Geller,"Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?",Sorry!
Ross Geller,"How hot do I look in this, huh?!","Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?"
Ross Geller,Maybe that will liven up this party.,"Okay, will you just go help her change please!"
Ross Geller,I really wish that you wouldn't.,"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone."
Ross Geller,Lift!! And slide!,"Okay, here we go."
Ross Geller,"Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.",Too?
Ross Geller,"Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.","Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking."
Ross Geller,What?!,"Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories."
Ross Geller,How did you know about that?!,We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Ross Geller,Were you the ones called the cops?!,"That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding."
Ross Geller,Why not?,Because we hate them.
Ross Geller,Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!,We have heard you play.
Ross Geller,So?,No!
Ross Geller,"Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?",Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Ross Geller,"Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!",Smooth.
Ross Geller,"Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.",Huh.
Ross Geller,Hey.,Hi! How'd it go?
Ross Geller,Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.,Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Ross Geller,Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!,"So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?"
Ross Geller,What?! Chandler she's our cousin!,I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Ross Geller,Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!,A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Ross Geller,"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!",What?
Ross Geller,That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.,You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
Ross Geller,So?,So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Ross Geller,"Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.","Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you."
Ross Geller,When I got married you slept with my sister.,That was pretty 007.
Ross Geller,Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.,I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Ross Geller,Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.,"Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?"
Ross Geller,What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!,Let me try it on!
Ross Geller,"Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.",Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Ross Geller,What?,An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Ross Geller,Let me see that! Oh man!,The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Ross Geller,"Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.","I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!"
Ross Geller,"Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.","Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that."
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?",Who are those people?
Ross Geller,Dude! How-how did you write this?,I stole Monica's and changed the name.
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.",What's up?
Ross Geller,"Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.","Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night."
Ross Geller,"No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.",But you're still my friend?
Ross Geller,Not for the next few minutes.,"During this time...are you, are you still my best man?"
Ross Geller,Nope.,Do I still call you Ross?
Ross Geller,"Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!","Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning."
Ross Geller,No problem.,So are we...friends again?
Ross Geller,Yeah.,Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
Ross Geller,So this is your office?,How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Ross Geller,"She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.",No! No! No! I can't do that!
Ross Geller,What's wrong with being the Bings?,The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Ross Geller,"Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?",No.
Ross Geller,Then you are neither of your parents!,"It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity."
Ross Geller,"Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?","Well yeah, but then..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?",Depends on what you mean by we.
Ross Geller,"There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?",No.
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.","Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?"
Ross Geller,"Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!",Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Ross Geller,Yeah.,"Okay, excuse me for a minute."
Ross Geller,"Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!","Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air."
Ross Geller,Okay.,Okay.
Ross Geller,There he is!!,What?
Ross Geller,You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!,Ross!
Ross Geller,Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!,That's right! I'm not!
Ross Geller,Then where the hell have you been?!,I know about Monica.
Ross Geller,What?,"Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking."
Ross Geller,What?! What?! Talking about what?!,You don't know?
Ross Geller,Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?,Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Ross Geller,Hi.,Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Ross Geller,Why not? It's built into the price of the room.,Yeah but you don't need--What is this?
Ross Geller,Thread!,Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
Ross Geller,What disposable cameras?,The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Ross Geller,No you didn't.,"Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said..."
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, ""Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"" Yeah, then you did that.",So you don't have the cameras?!
Ross Geller,No. Sorry man.,So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.",Great.
Ross Geller,Chandler?,Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Ross Geller,No. Did you?,Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
Ross Geller,"Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.","Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed."
Ross Geller,"Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?",All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
Ross Geller,I'm sorry man. Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.,Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Ross Geller,"No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.",Are you serious?
Ross Geller,I'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?,Marriage advice? Really?!
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?","I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers."
Ross Geller,What about the chairs?,She picked those out too.
Ross Geller,How about the place settings?,That was her.
Ross Geller,What did you do?,I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Ross Geller,Well go! Go move it!,"Okay, you ready for the last picture?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.,Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding.
Ross Geller,Now you are going to love these.,"Here's a picture of Ross. And that's me. And that's me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple."
Ross Geller,"Huh, didn't see that coming.","Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with...with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now."
Ross Geller,Not on the ones we sent out.,"So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!"
Ross Geller,Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.,"Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?"
Ross Geller,"Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.",The Hard Rock Caf?
Ross Geller,Yeah!,Again?!
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, I like the food!",You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob.
Ross Geller,Did that guy just call you Toby?,"Yeah, he thinks that's my name."
Ross Geller,"Well, why don't you correct him?","Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby."
Ross Geller,Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!,"No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel."
Ross Geller,"Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!",Shh! It is a family name!
Ross Geller,"Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? Well, I'm a potato or a...spud. And these are my antennae. So Sputnik, becomes... Spud-nik. Spudnik!",Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!
Ross Geller,Yes!,Marry her.
Ross Geller,That's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.,"Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed."
Ross Geller,"Uh, in her defense, she's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.",Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
Ross Geller,Pride.,And dignity.
Ross Geller,"So, you gettin' tired?",Nope! I can do this all day.
Ross Geller,Yeah? Me too. Gettin' a little tired though.,"God, I'm exhausted."
Ross Geller,"Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!",No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
Ross Geller,"Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.",You're Spudnik.
Ross Geller,"Come on, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.",Fine. Oh no!
Ross Geller,Yeah?,Would you tell her I let you win please?
Ross Geller,"Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!",I am strong! I'll show you!
Ross Geller,"Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!",She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
Ross Geller,"Well I...I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?","Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones."
Ross Geller,"Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.",I Understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
Ross Geller,Hey! She didn't look 50!,Did she look 16?
Ross Geller,She didn't photograph well!,"Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Ross Geller,Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school...,I don't think you did a very thorough job!
Ross Geller,Hello?,Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
Ross Geller,Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!,"Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's."
Ross Geller,"Uh, double latte, extra foam.",And a bagel with only...
Ross Geller,"Come on, it's fun!",All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, so far nothing stupid.",Mento?
Ross Geller,Oh cool!,That's great.
Ross Geller,Awesome!,"Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time."
Ross Geller,Yeah!,No!
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?",This game makes no sense!
Ross Geller,Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.,"Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here."
Ross Geller,What?!,This game is kinda fun.
Ross Geller,You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you...,I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Ross Geller,"Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!",Tell it to the Time Turtle!
Ross Geller,Yeah!!,This is the best game ever!!!
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.",You do?
Ross Geller,Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?,"Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated."
Ross Geller,"You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!",Really?
Ross Geller,He's a brilliant diagnostician!,Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Ross Geller,"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'",Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
Ross Geller,"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!",That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Ross Geller,I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.,"Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy."
Ross Geller,Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.,You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Ross Geller,"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.",I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Ross Geller,"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.",What?
Ross Geller,"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
Ross Geller,"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.","Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you."
Ross Geller,"Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.",Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Ross Geller,"So, so now do I get Joey?","Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose."
Ross Geller,You're really not coming back?,"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
Ross Geller,I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!,"I'm sorry, I won't be here."
Ross Geller,You got me a cola drink?,"And, a lemon lime."
Ross Geller,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.",And last but not least.
Ross Geller,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...,"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
Ross Geller,"What are you doing here, Santa?","Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
Ross Geller,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",What?
Ross Geller,What are you doing?,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
Ross Geller,"Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.",Why?
Ross Geller,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.",But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.","Fine, I'll give the suit back."
Ross Geller,"Answer faster, answer faster!",I don't know!
Ross Geller,"Answer better, answer better!","I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
Ross Geller,"What, you, you really quit your job?","Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
Ross Geller,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Hey.,Hey.
Ross Geller,You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.,"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
Ross Geller,Hey you guys!,Hey! Happy birthday ...
Ross Geller,"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.",Hi.
Ross Geller,Yeah.,"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.",Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Ross Geller,Whazzup??,"Seriously dude, 3 years ago."
Ross Geller,"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",You don't trust him?
Ross Geller,"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".","Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now."
Ross Geller,"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?","Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it."
Ross Geller,"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.",Picturing that tree?
Ross Geller,Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.,"I'm sorry, I got a little occupied."
Ross Geller,We have to stop them before something happens!,"Right behind you, big guy!"
Ross Geller,Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?,Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Ross Geller,OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?,No!
Ross Geller,OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.,"Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said""No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there."" And I said ""Maybe if we put some light out there they will"""
Ross Geller,"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !",So are you gonna...talk to her?
Ross Geller,"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!","You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
Ross Geller,"No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!",No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Ross Geller,"I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand.","Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
Ross Geller,"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.",Why did I get married?!
Ross Geller,Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.,"Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself...."
Ross Geller,That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?,What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Ross Geller,I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.,"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing."
Ross Geller,"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.",Did she go out with him?
Ross Geller,"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.",Ah! The high road...
Ross Geller,You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!,Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Ross Geller,"You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...",I thought I had to make the jokes!
Ross Geller,Don't you have to be at work?,"Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!"
Ross Geller,"Right, so that's a firm ""no"". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.","I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed."
Ross Geller,This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.,By drowning or...?!
Ross Geller,"So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?","Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
Ross Geller,"Hey hey, can I help?","Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky."
Ross Geller,"Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.","Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless ."
Ross Geller,It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?,The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Ross Geller,"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...",Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Ross Geller,No... I already e-mailed her.,"Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "" You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!"
Ross Geller,What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??,"Maybe we finish this for him! ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""... aaand SEND!"
Ross Geller,I have sex with dinosaurs??,I believe I read that somewhere!
Ross Geller,"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!",I respectfully disagree.
Ross Geller,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
Ross Geller,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.,I don't have a page.
Ross Geller,I'm dead?,And so young.
Ross Geller,Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.,"Well, how you died was funny."
Ross Geller,"Oh please, hit by a blimp?",It kills over one americans every year.
Ross Geller,"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.",You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Ross Geller,"uhu uhu, check this out.",Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Ross Geller,"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?","No, come on, you know that's not true."
Ross Geller,What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!,"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
Ross Geller,I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
Ross Geller,You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.,"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
Ross Geller,Exactly!!,"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
Ross Geller,No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
Ross Geller,"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!",There you go! Someone came!
Ross Geller,Who is he?,"Some guy, Tom Gordon."
Ross Geller,"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!","You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
Ross Geller,"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?","Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!","I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide."
Ross Geller,"Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.",Still on Amelia Earhart?
Ross Geller,No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.,Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
Ross Geller,"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.",I'll ask. Boohaki?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!","Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!"
Ross Geller,Think he washed his hands?,"Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?"
Ross Geller,"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.","I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm""."
Ross Geller,Why would I eat my own arm?,"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
Ross Geller,"I don't know, probably just invest it.",Ooh! Calm down ...
Ross Geller,"Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?",I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Ross Geller,Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.,"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye."
Ross Geller,"Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.",I don't have travel insurance.
Ross Geller,The big apple!,"I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
Ross Geller,Not there.,"Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
Ross Geller,She doesn't know what to say!,Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Ross Geller,"Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.",Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
Ross Geller,"Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!","Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
Ross Geller,"C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!","Dude, you're shaking!"
Ross Geller,"Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. Ross: What did you get?",USA Today.
Ross Geller,"Nice, put it with the others.",And I also got... two more apples.
Ross Geller,"We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!",I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Ross Geller,"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.","I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that."
Ross Geller,"Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.","Ok, how about this ?"
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!","Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!"
Ross Geller,Let's celebrate with some maple candy!,No!
Ross Geller,"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Ross: Oh my god.",What?
Ross Geller,There's something new in the bowl.,"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
Ross Geller,"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!",There's a forest right outside.
Ross Geller,It's not the same.,"Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.","Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!","I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?"
Ross Geller,Ok.,"So, a professor, uh?"
Ross Geller,Tsz... NO! .,Hey guys!
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.","I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
Ross Geller,It's in Barbados.,But you come first!
Ross Geller,So-so what did the doctor say?,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
Ross Geller,How do you feel about all this?,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Ross Geller,"If you want to check your email, just ask!",What? May I?
Ross Geller,Wha... what do you mean?,It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Ross Geller,"What, oh my God. What did you do?",Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Ross Geller,"Why, why would you open it?","Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!"
Ross Geller,What did it say?,Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Ross Geller,"What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!","It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?"
Ross Geller,NO! I don't!!,"Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
Ross Geller,Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!,I just feel awful.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!","Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her..."
Ross Geller,"Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...",Not to mention the cold sores.
Ross Geller,"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.",Really?
Ross Geller,"Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?",He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
Ross Geller,"Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?",You got it!
Ross Geller,Hey!,Hey!
Ross Geller,You guys ready to go?,"Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing."
Ross Geller,Dude! You're not taking your Bible?,"You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?"
Ross Geller,"No, I'll do it.",Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Ross Geller,WOW!,Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?",She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Ross Geller,"Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?",Why...why?
Ross Geller,"Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!","Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."
Ross Geller,I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.,Was that place... The Sun?
Ross Geller,Oh! And it gets worse!,Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Ross Geller,Go away! I don't want to see anybody.,"I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in."
Ross Geller,"Dude, you're not tanned.","No, I just had to get a picture of this."
Ross Geller,Thank you so much for that gift!,I was not ready for this today!
Ross Geller,"Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!",Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Ross Geller,"Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.",Was that Emma? Is she up?
Ross Geller,"No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?",I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
Ross Geller,"Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.","Let's do it, come on!"
Ross Geller,Seriously?,Word!
Ross Geller,Hey guys.,Hi Ross.
Ross Geller,"I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!",Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Ross Geller,Are you kidding?,"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us."
Ross Geller,That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!,"No, no! We made this decision together."
Ross Geller,Did I do something to you?,"Hmm, the game's at one."
Ross Geller,So?,"Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back."
Ross Geller,"Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.","That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand."
Ross Geller,That's worse than no food.,HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Ross Geller,"Really girls, not cool.","Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
Ross Geller,"Come on, she's gonna love you guys!","Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
Ross Geller,"It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.","Actually, we already found a house we love."
Ross Geller,Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...,Dangerous Liaisons.
Ross Geller,"No, 19.",Thanks man.
Ross Geller,Don't blame the questions!,Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Ross Geller,"Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!","Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!"
Ross Geller,"I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!","Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
Ross Geller,"Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?","Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house."
Ross Geller,"""...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll""!",I'm leaving you.
Ross Geller,"So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.",Who?
Ross Geller,He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.,Did I go to this school?
Ross Geller,"Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.","Sure, nice."
Ross Geller,Dude. You're married to my sister.,"You're right, by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?",Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Ross Geller,"Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!","Awesome, the name really stands out."
Ross Geller,"Thanks to a little something called ""Helvetica Bold 24 point""!","Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, Missy...","You know, our band is playing on Friday."
Ross Geller,Boss!,Mint!
Ross Geller,She's gone.,"I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out."
Ross Geller,"Dude, I was gonna ask her out.","I said it first, bro."
Ross Geller,"Well, I thought it first, Holmes.","Look, if you did..."
Ross Geller,"Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.",Totally. I had sex in High school...
Ross Geller,Me too. I'm good at it.,"All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg."
Ross Geller,You got it.,"All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
Ross Geller,Those are the pacts!,"Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway."
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh... maybe not you!","Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact."
Ross Geller,"Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?",Your hands are shaking.
Ross Geller,"You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?",Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Ross Geller,You broke the pact!,"Ross, that was 16 years ago!"
Ross Geller,That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.,"I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts."
Ross Geller,I didn't.,Oh really?
Ross Geller,No.,Oh really!?
Ross Geller,NO!,ADRIENNE TURNER!!
Ross Geller,I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.,"Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her."
Ross Geller,I don't know what... you're talking about.,Really?
Ross Geller,I didn't know you knew about that.,"Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: ""Betrayal In The Common Room""."
Ross Geller,Man... I... I'm sorry.,Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Ross Geller,"So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.",Hmm mmmhm..
Ross Geller,"We are even, right?","Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?"
Ross Geller,What did you do to my mom?,Not her!
Ross Geller,"Well, it matters to me.",Why?
Ross Geller,Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.,You kissed her that night too?
Ross Geller,"Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.",Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Ross Geller,Mine.,I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Ross Geller,"No, she was definitely on my bed.","Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, man!",This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
Ross Geller,FOOTBALL!,Thank you.
Ross Geller,I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.,"I know, I hate being left out of things."
Ross Geller,I'll do it!,M-Me-me-me!
Ross Geller,"Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.","Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!"
Ross Geller,"Please, you're going down!",You are going downer!
Ross Geller,Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?,"I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!"
Ross Geller,Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.,That's what I was doing too.
Ross Geller,"Well, you have fun tonight.",You too.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I will.",Me too.
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?",I'm not supposed to tell you.
Ross Geller,I'm not supposed to tell you!,You told us both we could be in the wedding?
Ross Geller,"Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.","Rach, Rach, knock knock."
Ross Geller,"No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?",I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Ross Geller,I'll...,Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
Ross Geller,"Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...",A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.",Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Ross Geller,...that center around work.,To Ross!
Ross Geller,That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.,It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
Ross Geller,Should we send something?,How did the job stuff go?
Ross Geller,So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?,Or facing a bitch of a commute.
Ross Geller,"You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!","No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs."
Ross Geller,"Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.",I didn't know Monica had these!
Ross Geller,"Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?","I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!"
Ross Geller,"Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.","Uh, Rach?"
Ross Geller,I don't think so.,"Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years."
Rachel Green,"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.",That is amazing.
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.","If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do."
Rachel Green,"Hello, Paul.","Hi, Paul, is it?"
Rachel Green,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Rachel Green,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!","Oh, how well you know me..."
Rachel Green,Would anybody like more coffee?,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
Rachel Green,"Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.","Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-"
Rachel Green,"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...",...Dinah?
Rachel Green,"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!","Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..."
Rachel Green,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.","Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
Rachel Green,It's worse than the thumb!,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.","Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!"
Rachel Green,"God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.","Oh, this is not that bad."
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?","Alright. Yes, this is Rachel."
Rachel Green,I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.,"To the left, to the left- aww!"
Rachel Green,Come on! You guys can pee standing up.,"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.","Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
Rachel Green,"Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!","You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!","Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here."
Rachel Green,Tah-daaah!,Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Rachel Green,Who is being loud?,"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?","No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?"
Rachel Green,"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...",You did?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.","Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
Rachel Green,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.",I thought it was $98.50.
Rachel Green,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?","All right, I'm nine years old."
Rachel Green,Oh my god.,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Rachel Green,"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.","Oh, you must stop shooping."
Rachel Green,"I can't, I gotta go.",Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".",Do either of you have the keys?
Rachel Green,By all means.,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
Rachel Green,And a crappy New Year.,"Here, here!"
Rachel Green,"Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?","Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!","Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
Rachel Green,"That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock",I'm sorry!
Rachel Green,You have no respect for anybody's privacy!,"Rachel, wait, wait."
Rachel Green,"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!",Can I just say one thing?
Rachel Green,What? What?!,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Rachel Green,Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?,"Oh, yes, could I have one of those."
Rachel Green,"No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?",Okay.
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.","Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies."
Rachel Green,"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.","Okaaay, rock, hard place, me."
Rachel Green,"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?",What? What?
Rachel Green,"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.",Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Rachel Green,I thought it was Chandler!,What? What?
Rachel Green,You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!,"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
Rachel Green,Wow.,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Rachel Green,"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.","If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
Rachel Green,"Oh my god. Janice, hi!",Janice is gonna go away now.
Rachel Green,... the WENUS?,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Rachel Green,Career counselor?,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
Rachel Green,I don't!,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
Rachel Green,My God! What happened to you?,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
Rachel Green,Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, howd she take it?","Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk."
Rachel Green,"What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!","Alright, what have we learned so far?"
Rachel Green,Settle what?,"The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so..."
Rachel Green,"Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!","Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?"
Rachel Green,"OK, OK, it's my turn.",Go.
Rachel Green,"Oh, that is so sick.",I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Rachel Green,Why?,I have my reasons.
Rachel Green,"Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God.

Rachel Green,Nope. We took her to lunch.,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Rachel Green,Shut up!,Tell me what?
Rachel Green,"Well, you were pretty damn good.","Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate."
Rachel Green,"No, forget it.","Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
Rachel Green,"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?",You have to pick your moments.
Rachel Green,"Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?","Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, why?",No reason.
Rachel Green,"Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.","I know, I still am one of these."
Rachel Green,Pardon?,"Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft."
Rachel Green,"Well, thank you, Melanie.","OK, this one right here is from me."
Rachel Green,Who's this from?,"Oh, that's Ross's."
Rachel Green,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!","Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?"
Rachel Green,What did you just say?,ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Rachel Green,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?",F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel Green,Oh.... my God.,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
Rachel Green,"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.",H-He's in China!
Rachel Green,I-I-I don't know.,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Rachel Green,"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.","Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!"
Rachel Green,"Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.","Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
Rachel Green,Did you talk to him?,Not yet.
Rachel Green,"Then, no.","So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
Rachel Green,"Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?","He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever."
Rachel Green,How is that the silver lining?,You have to really wanna see it.
Rachel Green,"I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.","Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
Rachel Green,"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",What stupid thing did you do?
Rachel Green,"Come on, they were not that huge.","I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain."
Rachel Green,"All right, bye-bye.","Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky."
Rachel Green,Have you ever seen so much crap?,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
Rachel Green,Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.,Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Rachel Green,You are ready to make a commitment!,Whoa! Don't know about that.
Rachel Green,It's really not that big!,"Takin' that with you, huh?"
Rachel Green,"So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?",I got the time to get to know Julie.
Rachel Green,"Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?",I'm goin' home.
Rachel Green,"Hi, Julie.","Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, whoosh!",But it's Ross.
Rachel Green,Oh!,No.
Rachel Green,"So, how was the party?","Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?"
Rachel Green,"Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.",So you really OK about all this?
Rachel Green,"Oh, god.",Ohhh.
Rachel Green,"Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?",What? Nothing.
Rachel Green,What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?,"No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!"
Rachel Green,And I'm in it? Then let me read it.,No!
Rachel Green,"What is this? Ross, what is this?",Good luck.
Rachel Green,That's what I said.,"Look, maybe we should go?"
Rachel Green,"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.",Who said anything about Christmas?
Rachel Green,I had one glass.,I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Rachel Green,Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?,"No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?"
Rachel Green,I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?,Me.
Rachel Green,Why would I have to sleep with you?,It's my game. You want the job or not?
Rachel Green,"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?","You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true."
Rachel Green,And she's not crazy?,"Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore."
Rachel Green,"They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.","OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut."
Rachel Green,Hi you guys.,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .","Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice."
Rachel Green,What's this.,Could you get us a couple of beers?
Rachel Green,"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.",But...
Rachel Green,"Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.",We're worried about you.
Rachel Green,"Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.","Ding dong, the psycho's gone."
Rachel Green,What's the matter with you?,The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Rachel Green,Hi.,"Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one."
Rachel Green,Look at her.,Hi Monica.
Rachel Green,"Agh, it was the graduation from hell.","Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship."
Rachel Green,"Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?","Well, we could count again."
Rachel Green,"Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.","Well, actually just one birthday flan."
Rachel Green,What?,"It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee."
Rachel Green,"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?","Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
Rachel Green,"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Rachel Green,"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...","I, I know."
Rachel Green,Wow! What's that like?,"It's like this, me, no jokes."
Rachel Green,Hey!,"I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.","Ooh, oh, oh, that's her."
Rachel Green,"Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.","Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up."
Rachel Green,"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.",We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Rachel Green,Noo.,"Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow."
Rachel Green,"Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.","Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her...."
Rachel Green,Good luck Chandler.,Thank you Rachel.
Rachel Green,What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?,"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
Rachel Green,"Amazingly, that makes sense.",You think?
Rachel Green,"Honey, this will help.","So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down."
Rachel Green,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?",She said she'd call me.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you do.","So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
Rachel Green,"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.","So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
Rachel Green,"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.","I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
Rachel Green,Yeah.,Hello!
Rachel Green,"Yes, and grumpy.","What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!"
Rachel Green,"He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.",I love you too.
Rachel Green,"Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?","I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head."
Rachel Green,Hardy Boy.,Peter Parker.
Rachel Green,So?,"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, so?",And now I've picked it up again.
Rachel Green,"But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.",I'll go.
Rachel Green,Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?,I will have one.
Rachel Green,I almost caught that one!,"Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7."
Rachel Green,I got a touchdown! We did it!!,"Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!"
Rachel Green,What?,"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?"
Rachel Green,"Eh, do you believe that?",Yeah?
Rachel Green,"Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.","How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?"
Rachel Green,The fear?,"He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.","Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here."
Rachel Green,"Gunther, I quit.",Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Rachel Green,Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!,Something else I might have said?
Rachel Green,"No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.",You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Rachel Green,"Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!","Sure, everybody loves a kidder."
Rachel Green,Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.,Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Rachel Green,Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?,"Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress."
Rachel Green,Oh.,"Hey, so can you make it on Friday?"
Rachel Green,"So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?","Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?"
Rachel Green,Right.,"And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!"
Rachel Green,Hello.,"Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen."
Rachel Green,You have a play date with a stripper?!,"Man, I gotta get a kid."
Rachel Green,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.","Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
Rachel Green,"Monica, what are you doing?","Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him."
Rachel Green,Joey! I can't believe you just did that!,I can't believe she cracked your code!
Rachel Green,Is he here?,No.
Rachel Green,"You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?","Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross."
Rachel Green,Hm-mm.,"Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine."
Rachel Green,Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!,"Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!"
Rachel Green,"No, I stuff outside the bra.","Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.","Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us."
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.","Oh. Nope, that patch is no good."
Rachel Green,All right.,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?","Y'know what, pretty good."
Rachel Green,Yeah?,"Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse."
Rachel Green,"Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.",What check thing?
Rachel Green,We use it!!,There you go!!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! The millionaire's here!,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.","Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem."
Rachel Green,"Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?","Yes, I realise that."
Rachel Green,Summer catalogue!,That's the stuff!
Rachel Green,"Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...","Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!"
Rachel Green,"That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?","Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it."
Rachel Green,Ahhhh!!,"Hey, my Father's house does that!"
Rachel Green,"O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.","Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
Rachel Green,Hmm.,"Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?",That's what you say at the end of a date.
Rachel Green,"You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'","To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion."
Rachel Green,Call her! Call her now!,"Multiple, so many paper cuts."
Rachel Green,"Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!","Oh, well give me the phone then."
Rachel Green,"Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!","Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'"
Rachel Green,Well then you're going to have to take her out again.,Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Rachel Green,"I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!","All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!"
Rachel Green,That's fine!,"That's just a lot of big talk, y'know."
Rachel Green,Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!,Noo!
Rachel Green,Chandler!!,"Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.",Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Rachel Green,"Okay, bye-bye!",Bye!
Rachel Green,Hey guys! What's...,"Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
Rachel Green,Hi!,Hey!
Rachel Green,Yes!!,"All right buddy, way to go!"
Rachel Green,"Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.","Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em."
Rachel Green,Hey!,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, thank you.","Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on!",Big bullies!!
Rachel Green,"Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?","Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house."
Rachel Green,Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.,G'night.
Rachel Green,"And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",I KNEW IT!!!!
Rachel Green,Why? I love that thing.,You want it?
Rachel Green,All right!!,I'm coming already!!
Rachel Green,"My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.","Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink."
Rachel Green,"You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?",No. No!
Rachel Green,"I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'","Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
Rachel Green,"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!","Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself."
Rachel Green,"Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.","Okay, I promise, I'll end it."
Rachel Green,Thank you.,"I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean."
Rachel Green,What?!,"Rachel, could I see you for a moment?"
Rachel Green,You promised you would break up with her!,"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!"
Rachel Green,And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!,"It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out."
Rachel Green,"Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.","No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!",Never!
Rachel Green,You never come into this office again!,Fine!
Rachel Green,You give me back my Walkman!,I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Rachel Green,"Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!",You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Rachel Green,Does it hurt?,"No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!"
Rachel Green,Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?,About what?
Rachel Green,"When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!","I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!"
Rachel Green,"No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!","Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.","Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go."
Rachel Green,What if I clean your bathroom for a month?,It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Rachel Green,Foot rubs for a month!,Freedom!
Rachel Green,I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!,"Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!"
Rachel Green,"I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.",No!
Rachel Green,I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!,With extra pulp?
Rachel Green,Yeah!!,No!
Rachel Green,D'oh!! I've got it!,You don't have it.
Rachel Green,"I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.",Go on.
Rachel Green,I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.,And Milton Berle has a...
Rachel Green,So did you break up with Joanna?,I think so.
Rachel Green,"Hey! So, did you quit?","No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.","We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?"
Rachel Green,What are you ever gonna use that for?!,To pay for the gym.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, she's...","She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?"
Rachel Green,You love her.,"No, I don't."
Rachel Green,"Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!","Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils."
Rachel Green,"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?","Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren."
Rachel Green,You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.,Sure...
Rachel Green,And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?,"I don't know... um, Grease?"
Rachel Green,No....,Rent?
Rachel Green,Yes! Rent!,"Okay, so when do you want to go?"
Rachel Green,What did you get her?,A pen.
Rachel Green,Any luck?,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy."" Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?"
Rachel Green,"All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.","She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her."
Rachel Green,"Aw, honey, that's so sweet.",Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Rachel Green,"Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.",Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Rachel Green,Because you do.,"Yeah, I know."
Rachel Green,So are things with you and Joey any better?,"They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me."
Rachel Green,"I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...","Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her."
Rachel Green,People are trying to sleep in here!,"Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
Rachel Green,"Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.",Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?","Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
Rachel Green,"Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.",Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Rachel Green,Really?!,"Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?"
Rachel Green,"So, will I like any of these guys?","Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more."
Rachel Green,Chandler!,Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!","Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards."
Rachel Green,"Op, I like credit cards!","See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?"
Rachel Green,"Well, so what does he do?","Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."
Rachel Green,Your company has a fine foods division?,"It's a big company, I don't-if you-I..."
Rachel Green,Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!,"Well, like father, like son."
Rachel Green,Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.,Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?","Ummmmmmmm, no."
Rachel Green,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!,Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Rachel Green,"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",I did! I absolutely did!
Rachel Green,You idiot!!,"I'm sure you're right, but why?"
Rachel Green,You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!,"Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry."
Rachel Green,"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",I know! I know!
Rachel Green,"Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!","Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once."
Rachel Green,Really?,"Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
Rachel Green,No.,"Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?"
Rachel Green,Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.,"Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth."
Rachel Green,"What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!",So there is no good time to ask that question.
Rachel Green,But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?,"Well, you-you know what I meant."
Rachel Green,You guys are really right...there aren't you?,Yes. Right where?
Rachel Green,Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!,"No, he's right, I'm totally lying."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.","Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"""
Rachel Green,"Let me see that. Oh, yeah.",That's one?
Rachel Green,"Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.",Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Rachel Green,What is that noise?,You!
Rachel Green,Oh my God.,YEAH!!! YES!!!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!,Well believe it baby!
Rachel Green,"I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.","Cool, girl roommate."
Rachel Green,Beefsteak Charlie's?,Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Rachel Green,They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!,Ow!
Rachel Green,How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!,"Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time."
Rachel Green,I don't get this! She was horrible!,"Okay, I'm going to go stand over there."
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!","So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?"
Rachel Green,"No, I don't.","All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on."
Rachel Green,"Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...",Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Rachel Green,"Well, are we all together? Like in a group?",Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Rachel Green,"No-no-no, that' not Joshua.","What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, there's a guy right over there.",That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Rachel Green,"Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.","Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?",Hello!
Rachel Green,You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.,"Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!"
Rachel Green,"Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.","Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?"
Rachel Green,"Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.",What are you talking about?
Rachel Green,Surprise!!!,Surprise!!
Rachel Green,"Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.",Like what?
Rachel Green,Hey.,Hey.
Rachel Green,"You're a pathetic loser, right?","Oh-ho, yeah!"
Rachel Green,"All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?",Oh no-no-no-no!
Rachel Green,What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.,It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Rachel Green,"No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.","Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?"
Rachel Green,Hey!,"Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
Rachel Green,"Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?",Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Rachel Green,"Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.",No thank you.
Rachel Green,"All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.","Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!"
Rachel Green,Hi!,"Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool."
Rachel Green,"Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!",What?
Rachel Green,"Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.","Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings."
Rachel Green,Why not?,"Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this..."
Rachel Green,What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?,"See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden."
Rachel Green,"Oh, honey, I don't know. I...","This isn't one of those uh, y'know ""If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?"" Right? Because I already bought my ticket..."
Rachel Green,Who's this from?,"Oh, that's Ross's."
Rachel Green,What did you just say?,F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel Green,"And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",I KNEW IT!!!!
Rachel Green,"If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!",Your sister Joan is crazy.
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?","Yes, we do. But, we have to change first."
Rachel Green,"Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!","Oh, yay..."
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...","Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?"
Rachel Green,"Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?","Yes, we do. But, we have to change first."
Rachel Green,"Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!","Oh, yay..."
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...","Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?"
Rachel Green,"What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.",Oh that's not true.
Rachel Green,"That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.","Okay, I gotta go to work."
Rachel Green,"Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!",I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Rachel Green,"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?","Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
Rachel Green,What's going on?,We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Rachel Green,"Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?","Aww, man!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?","Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year."
Rachel Green,"Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?",Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...",What is going on here?
Rachel Green,Joey has got a secret peephole!,Oh no! No! No! No!
Rachel Green,"Oh, great!","Okay, bye! Oh my God!!"
Rachel Green,"Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.","Okay, good luck with that."
Rachel Green,"Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.",And a date with a man!
Rachel Green,"Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...","Oh, hey!"
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.","Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.",And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Rachel Green,"Hey, what's-what's going on?!","Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
Rachel Green,And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.,"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head."
Rachel Green,"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.",Wh-wh-why?!
Rachel Green,"Well, because she loves you and because you love her.","Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
Rachel Green,"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.","I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?"
Rachel Green,"No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.","Okay. It's not different at all, is it?"
Rachel Green,"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?","Okay, how long is this going to go on."
Rachel Green,"Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?","Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
Rachel Green,"Well, I brought the next best thing.",Hey!
Rachel Green,Okay!,Okay.
Rachel Green,"I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!","Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
Rachel Green,No!,So what happened?
Rachel Green,"Well, I didn't know what else to do!","Well you coulda tried, not kissing him."
Rachel Green,"I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!""","Come on, Rach."
Rachel Green,"Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...","Unwilling to steal from work, interesting."
Rachel Green,"I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!","Yeah, it is the best."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I can do that.","Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke."
Rachel Green,Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.,"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!"
Rachel Green,I did not!,Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Rachel Green,"All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!",I wish I had smoked for my career...
Rachel Green,"No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.","Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!"
Rachel Green,"Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.","If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?"
Rachel Green,I tried! They won't take her back.,Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Rachel Green,"No, I meant with the dropper over here.","Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper."
Rachel Green,Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!,"Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!"
Rachel Green,Ross! Stop it! Come on!,How much did I love The King and I?
Rachel Green,Damn!,Hey!
Rachel Green,Eh! Stop it!,Hey!
Rachel Green,Who got married?!,You did.
Rachel Green,"Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?","Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free."
Rachel Green,"All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.","All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it."
Rachel Green,Hey!,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.","Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously."
Rachel Green,"I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!","Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty..."
Rachel Green,What?,All yours babe.
Rachel Green,"And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.",Rach...
Rachel Green,Hey roomie!,"Okay, bye!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.",Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Rachel Green,When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.,What?
Rachel Green,"But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.",That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.",What???
Rachel Green,"Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.",I am proud of all my friends today.
Rachel Green,"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.","I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
Rachel Green,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,What? That's terrible!
Rachel Green,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?","No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?","No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?","If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
Rachel Green,We are so gonna find them this year.,"Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?"
Rachel Green,Yeah.,"You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?"
Rachel Green,"Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?",Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Rachel Green,Ha!,"Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?"
Rachel Green,"Ooh, let's open them!",Okay! Okay! Okay!
Rachel Green,"Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.","Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?"
Rachel Green,I know.,"Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff."
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.",I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Rachel Green,Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?,A pharmacist.
Rachel Green,"Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.","Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore..."
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.","Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?"
Rachel Green,"Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!",What are you doing here?
Rachel Green,"Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?",We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!",He's taking off her coat!
Rachel Green,Oh.,"Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!"
Rachel Green,Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.,Is that a swing?
Rachel Green,Oh don't even ask!,Yuck!
Rachel Green,"Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.",She's just doing her job!
Rachel Green,What?! You kissed!,Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Rachel Green,You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?,Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Rachel Green,"Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!",She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Rachel Green,"Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.","Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut."
Rachel Green,Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.,You just thought of that in there?
Rachel Green,Thanks!,"So, you busy Thursday?"
Rachel Green,Do you guys know any cute guys?,"Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here."
Rachel Green,"Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.",So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.",Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Rachel Green,I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!,"Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?"
Rachel Green,All right.,"Okay, so you will meet our guys?"
Rachel Green,"Yes, I'll meet 'em.","Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself."
Rachel Green,I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.,"Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!"
Rachel Green,Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.,"Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!"
Rachel Green,I-Ohh!,There you go! There you are!
Rachel Green,"Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.",So what was it for anyway?
Rachel Green,Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!,Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Rachel Green,"And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",I KNEW IT!!!!
Rachel Green,"Okay, Chandler!",Okay.
Rachel Green,"And your horoscope says, ""On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift.""","Oh, well thank you in advance."
Rachel Green,Hi!,Hey!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!,I know.
Rachel Green,Hey!,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?","Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!"
Rachel Green,Okay.,Okay.
Rachel Green,Hey!,You look great!
Rachel Green,"Oh, thanks.",You okay over there?
Rachel Green,"I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.","Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody."
Rachel Green,"Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?","What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...","Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
Rachel Green,"Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!","Honey, it's gonna be okay."
Rachel Green,"No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.","Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.","Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?"
Rachel Green,Hey!,"So, what do you think?"
Rachel Green,Yes!,No!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.","Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?",Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Rachel Green,"No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...",What about him?
Rachel Green,Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!,Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Rachel Green,"Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.","Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?"
Rachel Green,Yeah. Sure.,Can you people not see me?!
Rachel Green,"All right, I got 48.","Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?"
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",Is there a puppy here?
Rachel Green,Hi!,Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Rachel Green,Gooood morning!!,"Eh, somebody's in a good mood!"
Rachel Green,"Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.","Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker."
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Joey!,What is the matter with you?
Rachel Green,Hi.,"Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake."
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?",It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Rachel Green,"Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.",I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Rachel Green,"Why, why not?",Because it's too delicious.
Rachel Green,"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.","No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person."
Rachel Green,Hi!,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Rachel Green,"So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?",I can't seem to say goodbye.
Rachel Green,"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?",Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Rachel Green,"It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!",Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Rachel Green,Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Rachel Green,"What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!",So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Rachel Green,Its still there!,Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Rachel Green,She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
Rachel Green,No that could kill her.,"Well, we don't want that."
Rachel Green,No so we're protecting her.,But we should take it.
Rachel Green,But we should move quick.,Why?
Rachel Green,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! That is so good!,"I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it."
Rachel Green,"Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?",What are you doing tonight?
Rachel Green,Mm-mmm.,I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!","Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!"
Rachel Green,What?! What?!,Oh yes!
Rachel Green,Wait a minute!,Oh yes!
Rachel Green,You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!,"Well that's not fair, you've already had some!"
Rachel Green,"What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.",What do we use to split it?
Rachel Green,"Okay! All right, pick a half.","Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured..."
Rachel Green,Oh for God sake just pick a piece!,"All right, I'll pick that one."
Rachel Green,"That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!",Ohhh!
Rachel Green,"Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.","Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my..."
Rachel Green,Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!,Stick to your side!
Rachel Green,Hey Chandler!,Hey!
Rachel Green,"How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?","Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore."
Rachel Green,"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?",Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Rachel Green,I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.,That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Rachel Green,"Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...",Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Rachel Green,Yeah.,I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Rachel Green,Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!,"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
Rachel Green,Noo! Angels.,I'm gettin' my chair back!
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!",I think I should get the chair!
Rachel Green,No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.,"Well, where's the logic in that?!"
Rachel Green,"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Rachel Green,Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?,"No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun."
Rachel Green,Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!,Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Rachel Green,What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!,Monica's wasted.
Rachel Green,"No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.","Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!",No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Rachel Green,"No, I know! I get it! It's funny!","No, because you're not a grandmother!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it's just y'know...",Monica said wedding.
Rachel Green,Oh! I would love to read a poem.,Do you think you could get through a poem?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.",But I love swing music!
Rachel Green,"Well, what is the other reason?",I don't want to say.
Rachel Green,Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.,Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Rachel Green,"So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.","Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
Rachel Green,I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!,"Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice."
Rachel Green,Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.,You mean like for award shows?
Rachel Green,Some of them.,"You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, ""You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"""
Rachel Green,"Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?","Okay, who wore those?"
Rachel Green,"Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.",Not bad.
Rachel Green,This one is uh Paul O'Neil.,Who's that?
Rachel Green,"He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!",Pierce Brosnan?
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.,Are you serious?
Rachel Green,Yeah.,007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Rachel Green,Yeah.,"Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!"
Rachel Green,It's a pretty cool tux.,"Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?"
Rachel Green,"Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!",Whose is it?
Rachel Green,Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,Whose is it?
Rachel Green,I don't want to say.,"Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?"
Rachel Green,Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!,Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Rachel Green,Are you joking? Check out is not 'til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left.,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.","Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!"
Rachel Green,Hey Mona!,Oh! Hi!
Rachel Green,Why? You saw it? Is it scary?,"Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!",Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Rachel Green,What? Did her ass explode?!,"No, the baby's out! Look, look!"
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!",Oh! She's growing inside you.
Rachel Green,Whoa!!,Oh!
Rachel Green,Wow that was a big one.,I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Rachel Green,"Of course, of course.","A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.","Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about."
Rachel Green,Hey!,Hey!
Rachel Green,Is Joey here?,I don't see him. Do you see him?
Rachel Green,"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.",What does yours say Pheebs?
Rachel Green,"So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it's not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.","I know it's tough now, but things will get better."
Rachel Green,"How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!","I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?"
Rachel Green,Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.,What problem did you tell him you had?
Rachel Green,What?!,What?!
Rachel Green,I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!,You can always sell your baby.
Rachel Green,It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.,"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, can you give us a minute?","Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?"
Rachel Green,Yeah.,I'll be in there.
Rachel Green,"Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?","Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too."
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?",Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Rachel Green,Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!,Stick to your side!
Rachel Green,You too!,Thanks.
Rachel Green,"Oh Phoebe, that's a great story. Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea? Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!",Let's.
Rachel Green,Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?,Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!
Rachel Green,"That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.",So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Rachel Green,You know the book says that whenever she's sleeping I should be sleeping so...,Hey!
Rachel Green,Bye honey.,What's the matter Joe?
Rachel Green,Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?,You mean the lully story?
Rachel Green,Well actually...,Actually what?
Rachel Green,Ew! Gross.,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now."
Rachel Green,"Mon, I'm so sorry.",Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
Rachel Green,She needs changing.,"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first."
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.","I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
Rachel Green,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,What? That's terrible!
Rachel Green,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?","No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?","No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?","If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
Rachel Green,"Oh Chandler, stop talking!","Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
Rachel Green,What do you really want to do?,I have *not* thought this through!
Rachel Green,Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.,"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys."
Rachel Green,What? You really think she's hot?,Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Rachel Green,Thank you!,Now that Rachel's gone?
Rachel Green,"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...","First I was afraid, I was petrified."
Rachel Green,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?","See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
Rachel Green,"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.","Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
Rachel Green,"Oh, anything yet?","Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.",Alright I feel youger already!
Rachel Green,"Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!",They...do that?
Rachel Green,"Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?",What?
Rachel Green,Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.,Kinda like Joey.
Rachel Green,"Well, there's two spots left right?","Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie."
Rachel Green,You would do that? I never get picked!,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?","She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.","Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?"
Rachel Green,"Bye, see ya.",Ok.
Rachel Green,Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?,"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
Rachel Green,It's not the time Charlie.,"Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!"
Rachel Green,Open your drapes! Open your drapes!,I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Rachel Green,ooh...,Wow!
Rachel Green,How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?,YE-AH!
Rachel Green,"All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...","Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?"
Rachel Green,Sure...,Enunciate!
Rachel Green,oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?,How was your date with Joey?
Rachel Green,"Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!",You didn't like that?
Rachel Green,"Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?","Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..."
Rachel Green,"No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!",Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
Rachel Green,"Oh, she's still napping.","Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening."
Rachel Green,"Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!",To be fair this one does have nuts.
Rachel Green,I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!,"Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did."
Rachel Green,What?,"Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?"
Rachel Green,"Of course, I'd be honored!",Thanks!
Rachel Green,"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.","That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! ."
Rachel Green,Did you watch the tape?,No!
Rachel Green,But you are a liar.,What did I just say?
Rachel Green,Oooohh that's interesting.,"If you win, we give up the birds."
Rachel Green,"Hey, what's-what's going on?!","Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
Rachel Green,And a crappy New Year.,"Here, here!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.","Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer."
Rachel Green,Aah! Why? What are these for?,You'll see.
Rachel Green,"Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .",Aren't you...?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .",Right. So how're you doing?
Rachel Green,Bitchin',Hi Monica.
Rachel Green,I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.,Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?,"Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship."
Rachel Green,"Oh, what a line.",So where are you applying to?
Rachel Green,"Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!",I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Rachel Green,Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.,Heh.
Rachel Green,Hi.,"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
Rachel Green,"Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.","Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back."
Rachel Green,"All right fine, I pick you.","Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler."
Rachel Green,Who's there?,I'll tell you at the wedding.
Rachel Green,Oh!,"So, where's Mike?"
Rachel Green,Oh! It's not good.,"You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think."
Rachel Green,"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.",That is a bad interview.
Rachel Green,He offered me one.,That's great!
Rachel Green,"I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.",My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
Rachel Green,It should be right next to my plane ticket.,"Well, it's not."
Rachel Green,"Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!",At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.","No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room."
Rachel Green,"Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...","Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?"
Rachel Green,"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.",Pheebs!
Rachel Green,Can I talk to you alone for a minute?,Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Rachel Green,Oh honey...,"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.","Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance."
Rachel Green,Oh!,"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't."
Rachel Green,Hi! Oh my gosh!,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Okay, should we get some coffee?",Sure. Where?
Receptionist,"It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.","Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room."
Receptionist,"Oh, that's attractive.","Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
Receptionist,"Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?",New York.
Receptionist,"I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.","Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
Receptionist,"Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.",That's insane!
Receptionist,Great.,What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Receptionist,"Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.","Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax."
Kid,"I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.","You gotta do it, man."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.","Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,What?,What... did you get me there?
Janice Litman Goralnik,I got you...these.,Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.",That's great.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Ow!,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!",You remember Janice.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!",But you found me!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!",Kill me. Kill me now.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.","Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, no. Oh, no.",I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Janice Litman Goralnik,Oh.... my.... God.,"Hey, it's Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",That's OK.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Just us.,"Oh, what a crappy night!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.",Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Janice Litman Goralnik,"So, do we have the best friends or what?",Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Janice Litman Goralnik,I will go for that drink.,You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Each.,"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?","No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Hi, Monica.","Ok, well, this was very special."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Hello, funny Valentine.","Hi, Just Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,I brought you something.,"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever."
Janice Litman Goralnik,I had them made special.,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out."
Janice Litman Goralnik,That's fine.,It is?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.","Oh, no I don't."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?,"I did, but..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Helloo!!,"Oh, my, god!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Hey, it's everybody.","Janice, you're--"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Yes, I am.",Is it--?

Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.",You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.",I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.","Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!,Really.

Janice Litman Goralnik,Night-night Bing-a-ling.,"Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?","'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.","Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, you didn't have to do this.","Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.","Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip."
Janice Litman Goralnik,We should?,"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?","I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."
Janice Litman Goralnik,You probably want us to move in together?,It doesn't scare me!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...","Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"No, thank you. Chandler!","Hello, Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,What are you doing here?,"Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Are you being British?!,No. Not anymore.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?,"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Barley? What kind of party serves barley?,"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Where is this party?,Here in Chelsea.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Who's party is it?,A woman's
Janice Litman Goralnik,What woman?!,Chelsea.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?",Can I be that guy?
Janice Litman Goralnik,How's my Bing-a-ling?,"Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Why are your eyes so white?,"You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Oh my God!!,All right!
Janice Litman Goralnik,How did you know?,"Joey told me, he saw you two kissing."
Janice Litman Goralnik,In the park?,No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Just those two!,"Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?",Here.
Janice Litman Goralnik,The receipt.,"I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Okay.,"I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Wow!,"Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.",Then don't leave me!
Janice Litman Goralnik,What?,"Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.","No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance."
Janice Litman Goralnik,I'm sorry.,Ohhh. Don't go.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"No, I-I-I gotta go.",No. No! No! No!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Honey, honey, people are looking.",I don't care! I don't care!!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.",You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"I just came up to say, ""Hi!"" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.",Okay. Bye.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Bye.,Bye.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Bye.,Bye.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Bye.,B-bye!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Bye-bye.,Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh boy, I just love to sing!","Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.","Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!",Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.","I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?,"No! No! Not, Paris."
Janice Litman Goralnik,When?,I don't know exactly.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?","Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Okay, Chandler, come on!","Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.","Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.","Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
Janice Litman Goralnik,What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?,American Express?
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?","Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.","Okay, good-bye. Good-bye."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Chandler?,No!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Chandler!,"Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,No! No! I wanna see you take-off.,"Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!,No! You're the sweetest!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?","Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Chandler?,Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.",Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.","Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Why not?,"Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not."
Janice Litman Goralnik,He does?,Say again?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Chandler Bing!,Jan-Janice!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.",Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
Janice Litman Goralnik,It's you. This is yours.,What?!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!,That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Janice Litman Goralnik,OH MY GOD!!,"Oh, Come on!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...","No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .,What!?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Please... go! Just let me know if you need a hand!,I think it just fell off.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?",I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.","Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.","oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?","It was a ""Wendy's!! """
Janice Litman Goralnik,Oh my God! .,Sure.
Janice Litman Goralnik,What a small world!,And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie.","Don't, don't!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.",This can not be happening!
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.",The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.",Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Oh, me too...",Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Huh?,I never stopped loving you.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Oh... my...,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Chandler, what are you talking about?","Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing."
Janice Litman Goralnik,"I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.",Obviously.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.",Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.",I understand.
Janice Litman Goralnik,"Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing.",They're never coming down now.
Aurora,...Yes?,"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi."
Aurora,"Yes, you said that.","Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight."
Aurora,"...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.","Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
Aurora,...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.,"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
Aurora,No.,"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
Aurora,"No, I'm still married.","So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
Aurora,"Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.","Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
Aurora,I suppose mainly sexual.,...Hm.
Aurora,Thank you.,"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are."
Aurora,"Oh my God, I'm late.","Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.."
Aurora,Okay.,Don't go.
Aurora,"Okay. Oh no, I have to.","Too bad, she's leaving."
Aurora,I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.,"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
Aurora,It's not Rick.,"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!"
Aurora,"No, it's-it's Andrew.","I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
Aurora,He's... new.,"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?"
Aurora,"No, that's not exactly what I was..","Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
Aurora,So what do you want?,You.
Aurora,You have me!,"Nono, just you."
Aurora,Whaddyou mean?,Lose the other guys.
Aurora,"...Like, ...all of them?","C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
Aurora,"Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.","...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'"
Aurora,So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?,"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish..."
Aurora,Which one?,...The second guy.
Jill Goodacre,"Hi Mom, it's Jill.","She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
Jill Goodacre,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.",Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Jill Goodacre,"I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.","Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy."
Jill Goodacre,Would you like to call somebody?,"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks."
Jill Goodacre,Would you like some gum?,"Um, is it sugarless?"
Jill Goodacre,"Sorry, it's not.","Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it."
Jill Goodacre,"My God, you're choking! That better?",Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Jill Goodacre,"Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.",OK.
Jill Goodacre,"Well, this has been fun.","Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life."
Shelley,"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.","Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
Shelley,Do you want a date Saturday?,Yes please.
Shelley,"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-",He's a he?
Shelley,"Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-","No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
Shelley,Oh! Okay! Phew!,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
Shelley,"I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...","...Quality, right, great."
Shelley,"Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.","Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
Shelley,What? He's cute!,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
Shelley,Is Brian...?,"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
Shelley,"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.",Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Andrea,"Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.","Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
Lowell,"Hey, Chandler.",So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Lowell,It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not."
Lowell,I know. That's what I told her.,Really.
Lowell,Yeah.,So- you can tell?
Lowell,"Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.","So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
Lowell,"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.",He is?
Lowell,"Yup, and waaay out of your league.","Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian."

Ms. Mckenna,"Ok if everyone's on board, it's settled, Chandler, Chandler?",Yep.
Ms. Mckenna,Are you on board?,Yes.
Ms. Mckenna,What?,"It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying."
Ms. Mckenna,You fell asleep?,"But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing.

Ken,"That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?","Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?"
Ken,That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...,"Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me."
Ken,"I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?","I always liked you, Ken."

Ken,You can come to my house!,"Haha, no thanks!"
Claudia,I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?,"No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?"
Claudia,"Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?","Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not."
Claudia,My kid's in a play right now.,"Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."

Amy Green,Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's a lump.,"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two...."
Amy Green,"Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?","No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?"
Amy Green,Sorry.,"By the way, that fight was totally arousing."
Amy Green,"Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.",That sounds like fun.
Amy Green,"Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?",I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!

Wendy,"I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.","You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
Wendy,*Now* it feels like Christmas.,"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
Wendy,That was a nice pep-talk.,"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
Wendy,"So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?","Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional..."
Wendy,Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.,Ah. Thanks.
Wendy,"Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.",Ah. Chandler Bing.
Wendy,Ah. Fun conversation?,"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
Wendy,"Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?","This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
Wendy,...Missy?,I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Wendy,You are to me...,"No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!"
Wendy,So? I'm married.,I'm *happily* married.
Wendy,Oh. - What's *that* like?,"Right. So, I'm sorry..."
Wendy,"Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?","Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
Interviewer,"So, do you have any other question about advertising?","No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."""
Interviewer,Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.,Really? That's great!
Interviewer,It's an unpaid internship.,"It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
Interviewer,Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.,"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now."
Molly,I think it's sweet.,"Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma."
Blonde Girl,Sorry...we were just leaving.,We still got it!

Intern,"Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?","Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car."
Intern,"Seriously, you're an intern?","Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom."
Intern,Dude!,"Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope."
Intern,Your age?,"A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!"""
Boss,That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? Chander.,Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.
Boss,"Chandler, that's great!","Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me."
Boss,"You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's.... You did you come up with that?","I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow."
Boss,See all of you tomorrow.,The cold weather hurts my hip!

Mike Hannigan,And that's how it's done!,"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."
Mike Hannigan,That's what I'm thinking.,Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Mike Hannigan,"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.","Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
Mike Hannigan,"Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.","That's funny, we were doing the same thing!"
Mike Hannigan,"Hey guys, how is it going?",Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Mike Hannigan,"Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.",What happened?
Mike Hannigan,You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.,"Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus."
Mike Hannigan,"You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.","So technically, would this person be in the wedding?"
Mike Hannigan,I guess.,I'll do it!
Handyman,Thanks.....,Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Tom,"Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.","Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."

Kori,And you are...,"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."
Kori,I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Kori,We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.,"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
Second Message,"""Hey Chandler, it's Charlie""",This is..shhh!
Steve,"Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.","Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
Steve,"Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.","Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
Steve,"Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.","Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow ."
Bitter Lady,"Well, I bet you are all thinkin' ""Now would be a really great time for an intermission"", huh?","oh yes, God yes!!"

Zack,Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. Thanks!,"So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
Zack,You guys have such a great place here.,"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
Zack,Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.,That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Zack,Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...,You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
Zack,"Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?",Sure! Alright...
Zack,Ravioli's delicious!,I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Zack,"I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?",You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Zack,"No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.","Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
Zack,No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.,Ok.
Zack,Hey Chandler.,"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
Zack,No you didn't.,Really?
Zack,No you did.,"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it."
Zack,"Oh, thank you.","You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
David,"Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?",I wouldn't read too much into it.
David,"Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?","David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
David,"Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...","Seriously, we're gonna do this?"
David,"I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?","Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
David,That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!,What?
David,"Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.",I didn't mean now...
David,"Why not? It's brilliant! Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.","Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help."
David,How do you think I should propose?,"David, I'm pretending to read here!!"
David,"So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.","Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!"
David,"Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.",Nice!
David,I have a ring.,"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
Charlie Wheeler,Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!,"Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?"
Bill,We went through the same thing when we were adopting.,"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
Bill,"I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.",That's great. Can I see the book?
Owen,Yeah.,"I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too."
Owen,You were?,"Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother."
Owen,Huh?,You know how to use a compass?
Owen,I have a badge in it.,You do? That's fantastic!
Owen,You wanna see it?,"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you."
Owen,What?!?,What?
Owen,I'm adopted?,I got nothing.
Owen,I'm adopted?!,See? Intuitive!
Owen,He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.,Which technically now you should give back!
Owen,He isn't?!,"We have to get out of here, baby!"
Colleen,"I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.",But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
Colleen,You told him he's adopted?,"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."""
Amanda Buffamonteezi,"Yes, I was looking for Monica.","Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya."
Amanda Buffamonteezi,"Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.","Well, aren't you a treat."
Laura,Oh...,What?
Laura,Yes!,Of course it was!
Laura,"Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.",RAT BASTARD!
Laura,So you're not friends with him?,"OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!"
Laura,What was that?,"Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though."
Laura,What's going on?,"Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls."
Laura,Is he alright out there by himself?,Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Laura,Bert and Ernie!,You can't make this stuff up!
Erica,Hi...,Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Erica,"So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.",That's what our friends call us.
Erica,"You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?",I don't think that's exactly...
Erica,Wow.,"Yeah, wow."
Erica,Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.,No-ot for me it doesn't.
Erica,So who are you?,"Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York."
Erica,I don't want to look at your file! This is over.,Erica wait!
Erica,I've nothing to say to you.,You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Erica,Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?,"Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising."
Erica,"Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.","But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?"
Erica,"Oh yeah, let's do that!",Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
Erica,"Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...","Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?"
Erica,"Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.",That's great.
Erica,"Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.","So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?"
Erica,"No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy.",I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Erica,"We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob.","Oh, really?"
Erica,"No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.","O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?"
Erica,"Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.",Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Erica,I don't know. Maybe church-camp?,"Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?"
Erica,What?,"Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both."
Erica,Help me! This hurts!,Is it really that bad?
Erica,I'm really happy for you guys.,How do you feel?
Erica,Twins actually run in my family.,Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
Erica,Bye!,Bye!
Erica,Okay.,Have fun at church-camp!
Agency Guy,I'll let you get acquainted.,Ok.
Agency Guy,Do you have any question for Erica?,"Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?"
Agency Guy,"Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We're very proud of it.",You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
Agency Guy,I don't understand.,The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Agency Guy,That's impossible.,I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Adoption Agency Guy,Hey.,Hey.
Missy Goldberg,Hey guys!,Hey!
Missy Goldberg,No way!,Way!
Missy Goldberg,Right. I'll be there.,Fresh!
Adrienne,Yes?,Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Doctor,Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?,"Well, that's spongy."
Doctor,"You know it's twins, right?","Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!"
Doctor,I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.,"Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good."
Doctor,Here she comes!,She? It's a girl?
Doctor,Yeah.,"Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!"
