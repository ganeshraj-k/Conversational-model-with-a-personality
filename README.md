# Personality Based Chat-bot STAT SOFTWARE RUTGERS COURSE. Prof -Ajita John

This project is a part of the Master of Science in Statistics, Specialization in Data Science program at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. It aims to address the challenges faced by chat-bots by endowing them with well-defined personalities.

## üéØ Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to enhance user experience and make chat-bot interactions more seamless and human-like. We aim to maintain context continuity, accurately recognize user intents, handle multi-turn dialogues, and improve emotion recognition.

## üìö Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the FRIENDS CORPUS dataset, curated by Cornell University. It includes speaker-level, episode-level, and scene-level data, along with some metadata regarding the scenes. For this specific use case, the interactions involving Chandler Bing were extracted. The dataset was enhanced by adding the episode title and plot summary for each interaction, sourced from the FRIENDS plot summary dataset available on Kaggle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

The approach involved exploring both transformer and non-transformer models, fine-tuning techniques, and carefully selecting evaluation metrics to assess the chat-bot's conversational and Q&A proficiency in natural language processing. The modeling for this problem was done through the following stages:

1. Initial Experiments with GPT-2 and Blenderbot
2. Fine-Tuning GPT-2 and XLNet
3. Seq2Seq Model with LSTM
4. Fine-Tuning T5-Small

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

BLEU score and ROUGE-1 F1, ROUGE-2 F1 scores were chosen as the key metrics to quantify and evaluate the model performances.

## üìù Conclusion

The project successfully contributes to a more user-friendly and reliable chat-bot experience by ensuring greater consistency, tailoring responses to specific personalities, and introducing contextual awareness.

## üë• Contributors

This project is the result of the hard work and dedication of Ganesh Raj Kyatham.
